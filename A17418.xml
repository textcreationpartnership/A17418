            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>When I firſt received this booke intituled, <hi>A lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Treatiſe of the Sabbaoth,</hi> a little before <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> laſt, though I was utterly ignorant of any ſuch controuerſie to haue paſſed betweene my <hi>Brother,</hi> and Master <hi>Edward Breerwood;</hi> and had not yet cast mine eye on the baſe language of the reply in the end of that Treatiſe; yet the very noveltie and dangerous vileneſſe of the Doctrine, without any reference to things perſonall, ſtrucke me. <hi>My ſpirit was ſtirred in me,</hi> when I ſaw the whole right of the Law for the time of Gods worſhip alleviated; the conſequence whereof muſt needs be this, the whole kingdome wholy given to Atheiſme and prophaneneſſe. <hi>The zeale of Gods glory and thy good began to eate upon me:</hi> I throw my ſelfe into the open field, that thou mayest be nouriſhed; I reſolved what I was, or am, or may be; ſhould be (Chriſt ſtrengthning mee) <hi>Gods and thine;</hi> that God the Lord of Heaven might have his Royaltie untouched, man his dutie laid out; Superiors directed to ſtand for God and Men, in the things of God, and Inferiors be Gods, while mens; and mens, in and for God.</p>
            <p>Now knowing that there are none but are fleſh, as well as ſpirit, and that the unregenerate part will catch at the moſt excellent truths, to ſucke thereout advantage
<pb facs="tcp:7551:3"/> to it ſelfe, by tearing a ſunder things inſeparably united, and taking to things hand over head in a wrong appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, fearing thy miſcarriage, I could not but adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thee a little, in that part that concernes thy duty.</p>
            <p>The ſuperiour or master may conceite his power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched upon, the inferiour or ſervant may ſuppoſe ſome unwarranted liberty granted him, all may thinke of an over-rigid construction of the unchangeable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.

               </gap>ſpute yeelds none of thoſe, neither preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the master, nor occaſion of liberty to the ſervant, nor other then a received and allowed ſenſe, to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing law, as will appeare to him that thorowly peruſeth it. But for prevention of over-hasty conceits in all, behold <hi>thy way-markes,</hi> before thou reade or receive any thought to fore-ſtall thee, take what I ſet here before thee, which hath beene ſeene, and heard, and allowed and received, <hi>Bleſſed be Gods holy Name,</hi> and I doubt not but ſhall be, maugre the malice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting ſpirits. For I admoniſh thee of no other things then what are already received, in the printed Bookes of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Nich. Byfield.</hi> Conſider, I ſay, what that <hi>Maſter of Aſſemblies</hi> hath left, in his writings as <hi>ſtakes</hi> to bound out the way of both master and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſuperiour and inferiour, in running the race of this fourth commandement, and as <hi>goades</hi> to quicken thy heart in the embracing of that divine Law.</p>
            <p>For the Doctrine of the Sabbath he thus explaineth himſelfe in two places,</p>
            <p>First, God hath provided by his <hi>unchangeable law</hi> that one day in ſeven, ſervants ſhall rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>M. Byf.</hi> on 1 Pet. 2. 18. pag. 723.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Servants muſt ſhew their feare of God in
<pb facs="tcp:7551:4"/> their callings, by carefulneſſe to doe Gods ſervice, as well as their masters, not onely by ſpending the Sabbath in the duties of religion, but in redeeming the time in the weeke dayes (as <hi>may bee without hinderance of their worke or offence to their maſters</hi>) to imploy themſelves in prayer, reading, conference, &amp;c. And the reaſon is, becauſe as ſervants muſt doe their maſters worke, as they are ſervants: ſo they ſtand bound in the common obligation, to do Gods ſervice, as they are men; and no man but is ſubject to <hi>the law of God;</hi> who hath given all his commandements <hi>to</hi> ſervants as well as <hi>to</hi> masters. <hi>Byf.</hi> in 1 Pet. 2. 18. pag. 734.</p>
            <p>For the ſervant he layeth downe theſe godly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory limitations, as Caveats:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſubjection of ſervants is of <hi>Divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> to which God hath bound them by the fift Commandement, and ſo is a morall and perpetuall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, in 1 Pet. 2. 18. p. 721.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no faults in Superiors, can free inferiors from their ſubjection, in matter or manner, in 1 Pet. 2. p. 742.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the matter bee onely inexpedient and unmeete, thou muſt obey, in <hi>Col. 3. 23. p. 130.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, thou muſt bee ſure that it bee ſinne that thou refuſeſt, if thou muſt needs doubt, it is better to doubt and obey, than doubt and diſobey, <hi>Id. ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, thou muſt in unlawfull things yeeld to <hi>obey by ſufferings, Id. ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, the ſervant muſt avoide <hi>inquiſitiveneſſe,</hi> the ſervant knoweth not what his maſter doth, <hi>Ioh. 15. 15.</hi> in <hi>1 Pet. 2. p. 735.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the maſter he giveth theſe heavenly admonitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7551:4"/>
            <p>Firſt, the master must give account of all hee doth to God, though he be not bound to doe ſo to inferiors, in 1 Pet. 2. p. 737.</p>
            <p>Secondly, good masters not onely licenſe, but teach their ſervants to keepe <hi>Gods Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>worſhip him.</hi> Commandement 4. <hi>Gen. 18. 19.</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. p. 736.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, masters doe not onely <hi>wickedly</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining their ſervants from the meanes of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or comfort, but doe <hi>fooliſhly alſo,</hi> in hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them of that meanes that ſhould make them good ſervants, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. p. 725.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they may not make their ſervants breake <hi>Gods Sabbath,</hi> to ſatisfie their wils, in <hi>Col. 3. 23. p. 130.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Aphoriſmes, that faithfull ſervant of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt being dead, yet ſpeaketh;</hi> unto which let me adde a word or two, that thou mightest on all hands be leftready to duty in this behalfe; Remember (if thou be a ſervant) that in workes of holineſſe, mercy and neceſsitie, the maſters power is to be obeyed in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his commands; for in thoſe is he under God, for God, and over thee. Then it is thy praiſe to <hi>follow</hi>

               <p>THat for a ſervant to do light buſineſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other worke on the Sabaoth day, although it were ſuch worke as might lawfully be done on another day; and although he did it not of his owne diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only in obedience to his maſters command; yet was a ſinne and tranſgreſſion of Gods Commandement touching the Sabaoth, and that he was not bound to yeeld, nay, that he ſinned againſt God in yeelding obedience to every ſuch commandement of his maſters that day, which by the precept of Almighty God, was wholly preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſecrated to reſt, and the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>This is the point oppugned by our Adverſary, whoſe reaſons ſhall be delivered in his owne words and confuted: I will neither adde nor diminiſh, but onely cut it into parts, that every part may receive its anſwer apart. This prefaced, I proceed.</p>

               <p>YOu are a teacher of Gods word, within the compaſſe of that word I will ſtay with you; and by it examine, with your patience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this frame of your Doctrine bee grounded on the rock, or on the ſand, on the firme rock of Gods Law, or on the fickle ſand of your own fantaſie miſunderſtanding the Law, and ſo whether it tend to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or ruine of the Church. For touching the commandement of the Sabaoth (vpon which I averre this Doctrine of yours cannot bee grounded) lay it before you and conſider it well, and tell me, to whom is the charge of ſervants ceaſing from worke on the Sabaoth day gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is it to the ſervants themſelves or to their maſters? It is given of ſervants I confeſſe, their worke is the matter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. But I demand, whether it be given and impoſed to the ſervants themſelves, or to the maſters whoſe ſervants they are? For if the Commandement bee not given to them, then doe they not tranſgreſſe the Commandements, if by their maſters they bee ſet to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7551:13"/> worke, but the maſters to whom the Law was given, that the ſervant ſhould not worke, and conſequently the ſinne is their maſters and not theirs: ſo if the Law be not impoſed to them, then it requireth no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of them, it obligeth them not; therefore is neither the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it, any ſinne to them, but only to thoſe to whom it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a Law.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the Commandement is given to ſervants alſo, the Words are, <hi>Thou, nor thy ſervant,</hi> which referred to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke,</hi> can have no other ſenſe than this; <hi>thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke, that art the maſter, nor thy ſeruant ſhall do no manner of worke</hi>

And can you bee ſo purblind as not to ſee, the Commandement is given aſwell to the ſervant, when it is thus delivered in the ſame forme, Thy ſervant ſhall doe no manner of worke? Nay, conſider, you the Publiſher (for, as for the Author hee knoweth already by the iſſue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his collection hence were ſound or no, and if he might have the favour the Saints had that aroſeat our Saviours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Iam perſwaded hee would judge this Treatiſe to the fire, and therefore) you the Publiſher I ſay, and all yee that feare God, and know that a bored eare is the beſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, conſider, The Commandement is given to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as a ſervant, and as thy ſervant. I will not worke, maieſt thou ſay, but my ſervant ſhall, his worke is mine by Covenant. The Lord with whom there is neither bond nor free, interpoſeth, and ſaith not, <hi>thou ſhalt not command him to worke,</hi> but thus, <hi>thy ſervant ſhall not worke.</hi> What is this but to ſay, as ſervant and as thine, hee ſhall not worke. As if hee ſaid, at other times his worke is thine, but now his worke is mine: thy covenant ſhall not infringe his covenant with his God. As thy ſervant, he is not thine in thy workes or ſervile workes that day, but the Lords freeman, yet thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7551:13"/> that day by thee to be injoyned to the Lords worke, Gods ſervant to be free from thy works. Thou muſt obſerve the Commandement in thine owne perſon, and preſerve it in the perſons under thy charge, thy ſervant muſt doe no manner of thy ſervile worke that day, but muſt bee thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to bee ordered for the Lords worke. Conſider it well and ſee, the matter forbidden is the ſervile cares and labors of the houſhold, both of maſters about ſervants, and of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants towards their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and ſeeing we are afforded by your good leave to conſider the Commandement, let us with your patience (for I cannot but thinke the heart of any deceiving or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not onely ſtumbled but convinced by the former words) weigh the Words of the precept, from which I thus reaſon:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſervant, <hi>eo nomine</hi> as a ſervant, is commanded to remember the day, therefore as a ſervant the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is given to him to ceaſe from his ſervile work, or the worke of a ſervant. For is hee to remember a part and not all the precept? Or may hee earth himſelfe in forgetfulnes, and put all on his maſters memory.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the ſervant as a ſervant is commanded to keepe the day holy. If any deny this, then God and <hi>Caeſar</hi> cannot have their due, God &amp; callings cannot ſtand together, God and ſocieties muſt ſubvert each other; and is this your quiet peaceable doctrine, that ruines all and brings confuſion? Yeeld the Antecedent and then this concluſion will follow, that hee is a a ſervant commanded not to worke: For reſt on the day is injoyned, that holineſſe may be followed, and ceſſation from worke forbidden, to whom holineſſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as the words runne, <hi>Remember the Sabbath or reſting day, to keepe it holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, That permiſſive mandate is not onely given of, but to the ſervant, <hi>ſixe daies thou ſhalt labour and do all that thou haſt to do,</hi> therefore the command for the ſeventh daies reſt is not only given of, but to the ſervant: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of both, reſpect the ſame perſons.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7551:14"/>
                  <p>Likewiſe this Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any work,</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him that is contained in the word, <hi>Thou:</hi> but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant as thy ſervant is contained in the word, <hi>thou;</hi> and is it not given to him then? For the words following expound the firſt <hi>Thou, Thou ſhalt not.</hi> Who meane you by this <hi>Thou?</hi> who but thou maſter, thy ſervant; thou father, thy ſonne; thou mother, thy daughter, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Further, the Commandement is given to them to whom the reaſons of the Command reach, but they reach alike to thy ſervant as to thee; therefore the Command reacheth alike to thy ſervant as to thee. And if you ſay, yea, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reach to all alike to perſwade to ſanctifie, but not to all alike to forbeare work; It is falſe: for, beſides that there can be no ſanctification without ceſſation from ſervile workes, the reaſons do equally and ſtrongly bend to perſwade ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from worke; as the reaſon from the right of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver appropriating it to himſelfe and his worſhip, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Law which giveth ſixe for worke, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines but for one day, the example of God, and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall bleſſing given to the day.</p>
                  <p>To come to handy-gripes with you: you yeeld, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants worke is forbidden. I demand, Is it forbidden; becauſe it hinders the maſter onely from ſanctifying the day, or the ſervant alſo? Surely, becauſe it hinders the ſervant cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not the maſter, or not chiefely: his worke croſſeth the end of the Sabbath in him, if therefore the command of ſanctifying the day bee to him as a ſervant, the command of ceaſing from worke is to him as a ſervant.</p>
                  <p>Let mee againe reaſon with you from the command; if the negative bee of the ſervant, and not to the ſervant, then alſo is the affirmative, which is this, Thou ſhalt doe the workes of holineſſe that day: and from hence will follow this groſſe abſurdity, that if the ſervant goe not to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, nor apply himſelfe to workes of holineſſe, and the maſter alſo doe not bid him, his maſter onely ſinneth, and not the ſervant; becauſe according to your new learning, the maſter is charged with the ſervant for the workes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7551:14"/> and the ſervants holineſſe that day is the matter only of the Command: the maſter and not the ſervant is the ſubject perſon commanded. This Command, Thou ſhalt doe the workes of holineſſe, is of the ſervants holy worke, but no precept to the ſervant. It may be you will flee off here-from, but you are caught in your owne net, as ſure as the negative precept hath his affirmative every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and ſeeing ſtore is no ſore, where each apart will make a party good <note n="b" place="margin">Quae proſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There can bee no way to<note place="margin">Servitus, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium, ſamula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, cultura.</note> exclude the ſervant at all from the charge of this precept.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, beſides all this, how is your doctrine built on the words of this Commandement; the Law ſaith, <hi>Thou and thy ſervant ſhall doe no worke;</hi> you ſay, it onely ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not command thy ſervant to worke.</hi> Againe, take your ſaying, the Law bindeth the Maſter from comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and will this follow, therefore it binds the ſervant to obey his maſter, if he ſhould be ſo wicked as to command what God prohibits him. This is a plaine <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7551:15"/> can not hold together by all the Geometry in the World, nor can any Carpenter make this joyne, but ſuch looſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings hold beſt for them that would goe in a broad way. Now weaken theſe following arguments if you can.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, hee that is circumciſed is bound to keepe the whole Law, and none is bound by your owne confeſſion, but he to whom the Law is given: the Iewiſh ſervant then, being circumciſed, was bound to keepe this Law as given to him. <hi>The circumciſed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is a debtor to doe the whole Law</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he that wrought on the Sabbath being a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was not fit for communion and ordinary converſing with the Iewes, as appeareth by the words of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that charged the ſtranger within the gate to reſt that day, and by the practice of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that drave ſuch from within and without the Citie Ieruſalem, and by a like inſtance of leaven at the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread. For if the ſtranger that ſojourned onely, and was not borne in the Land, did this while eate that which was leavened, he was to be cut off from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Iſrael <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 12. 19. See <hi>Junius</hi> on the place.</note>. Now ſhall the ſervant be left to the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that command, that makes him unfit for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the people of God? God forbid. Yet thus would you provide for ſervants, and be ſuch a ſinner againſt their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, how much better might you have tuned to <hi>Lyra's</hi> Harpe, than to runne a new ſtraine; he ſaith thus <note n="h" place="margin">Non loquitur de adultis, qui jam ſciebant legem Sabbati, quia prohibiti ſunt ſimul cum parentibus: ſed hoc additur pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pueris ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus legem, qui non debebant permitti dpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus aliquid operari in diem Sabbati.

               <p>FOr the better clearing of which point, let me aske you a queſtion or two of other Commandements, that for their forme are para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell to this, and whereof you have no prejudice. God commanded the Iſraelites, that no ſtranger ſhould eate of the Paſchall Lambe: againe, that no Ammonite nor Moabite ſhould enter into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord to the tenth generation. Good Sir tell me, did the Stranger ſinne if he eat of the Paſſeover being ſuppoſed invited? or did the Ammonites and Moabites ſinne if they came into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation being admitted? Did the Stranger, I ſay, and the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites and the Moabites in theſe caſes ſinne, of whom the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements were given, or the Iſraelites to whom the Commandements were given touching them: no, but it is clearely the Lords meaning, that the Iſraelites ſhould not admit of any Gentile to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Paſſeover, nor receive the Ammonites and Moabites into the Congregation of the Lord.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, I reply, theſe Commandements are not paralell, and ſo your ground faileth: theſe Commandements; I ſay, this, <hi>Thy ſervant ſhall doe no manner of worke;</hi> and this, <hi>No ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall eate of the Paſſeover.</hi> In the firſt, you acknowledge the maſters worke is forbidden to the maſter, whether done by himſelfe or by his ſervant. In the latter, the Paſſeover forbidden to the ſtranger, is enjoyned to the Iew. The Iew
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7551:16"/> muſt eate the Paſſeover, the Iew muſt not admit the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to eate, but the maſter muſt not worke, and muſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his ſervant to worke. The thing prohibited, <hi>viz.</hi> to doe ſervile worke on the Sabbath, is ſinfull in it ſelfe, but the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Paſſeover (which is the thing forbidden the ſtranger) was the ſpeciall worſhip of God, his ordinance and ſervice, required of the Iew. Now this makes a wide difference in the ſenſe of thoſe precepts that ſound alike: for where the thing is evill it cannot but be evill who ever doth it, that is capable of the divine precept, as the ſervant is; for he is a reaſonable creature, and was a Iew: but where the thing it ſelfe is holy, it becomes evill onely to him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneth and defileth it.</p>
                  <p>The Iew is made the obſerver of the Paſſeover, and the preſerver of it from the ſtrangers obſervation, but here the maſter and ſervant are both made obſervers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ceaſing from work, and the maſter is to preſerve it to the ſervants obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, where the words runne in the ſame forme, the precepts are not preſently paralell, or the prohibitions: for to make them ſo, the parties commanded muſt ſtand alike capable of the Law, or uncapable. Wee'le not goe farre for inſtance; the words in this precept are every way for forme of words paralell, <hi>Thy ſonne ſhall doe no manner of worke, the ſtranger within thy gate ſhall doe no manner of worke;</hi> yet the forme of the precept is not the ſame becauſe the ſonne of the Iew ſtood otherwiſe obliged to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as your ſelfe doe yeeld, pag. 25. than the ſtranger. And to put it beyond all exception, theſe for forme of words are paralell, <hi>Thy ſonne ſhall doe no worke, Thy cattell ſhall doe no worke;</hi> yet the precept is not paralell, becauſe the ſonne is capable of Gods Law to obey it properly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Zua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez. de leg. l. 1. c. 6.</note> cattell are not. There is a difference betweene the forme of precepts, and the forme of words, in which precepts are ſignified. The forme of the precept muſt partly bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſubjects, to which they have reference, and as they are capable, or leſſe capable of law, ſo the precepts to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7551:16"/> be underſtood: for the Law in its owne nature carrieth a certaine reſpect and diſpoſition to them, on whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <note n="m" place="margin">Lex eſſentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now for the Law of the Paſſeover, the ſtranger was not ſo capable of it, as being not under the Law; but the ſervant being a Iew, is alike capable of the Law of the fourth Commandement as is his Maſter, becauſe equally under the Law. What the Law ſpeaketh, it ſpeaketh to them who are under the Law <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note>, ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I affirme, that the ſtrangers, Moabites and Ammonites, did ſinne in thus doing, though invited or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they prophaned holy things, as <hi>Balthazar</hi> did the Bowles of the Temple <note n="o" place="margin">Dan. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

It is all one as if a Pagan living among us, that refuſed our Religion, and were not baptized, ſhould yet come and eate of the Bread of the Lord, though ſome Miniſter for ſome by reſpect ſhould be ſuppoſed to invite him. There were among the Iewes ſtrangers that kept houſe, and had ſervants, that yet were no Proſelytes, but onely ſtrangers within the gates; theſe ſinned againſt this precept, if they would kill the Paſſeover and eate it, although the ſewes ſhould through remiſſeneſſe ſuffer it. Further, that a ſtranger may ſinne againſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept given of him, is cleare by that precept in verſ. 48. of chap. 12. of <hi>Exodus, Let all his males be circumciſed, and then let him keepe the Paſſeover.</hi> The commandement is given expreſſely to the Iſraelites of the ſtranger, and yet if that ſtranger ſhould out of <hi>Zipporah's</hi> tenderneſſe hide or ſpare a male, and ſo eate, all the Iewes held that he ſinned againſt this precept given of him <note n="p" place="margin">Maimony in Korb.

It is evident alſo by the penaltie laid on the ſtranger, with whom leavened bread was found and eaten on the Feaſt of unleavened bread, hee was to be cut off from the Congregation of Iſrael (for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is to bee inflicted onely upon tranſgreſſors) and yet the Commandement of keeping the Feaſt of unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread was given to the Iewes onely in any fonne of words that we find verſ. 15, 17.</p>

                  <p>This precept, <hi>No ſtranger ſhall eate thereof</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 12. 43.</note>, hath been underſtood to bind the ſtranger there mentioned, aſwell as the Iew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Chaldee Paraphraſt renders it thus; <hi>No ſonne of Iſrael that is Apoſtate, ſhall eate of it:</hi> Now the Apoſtate Iſraelite ſinned if hee ate, aſwell as the Iew that invited him to eate, the perſons that were uncleane legally at the day of the Paſſeover ſinned, if they kept it at that ſeaſon, though the Governours tooke no notice of it, or would permit it. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>And for the Moabite and Ammonite <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 23. 3.</note> it is cleare, that it is ſpoken of them converted, &amp; made Proſelytes, who ſtood therefore bound to keepe the whole Law, as being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: for the Law ſpeaketh of a temporall puniſhment to be inflicted on them to the tenth generation after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; the one hundred generation of them remaining Heathen had been ſtill farre from admiſſion. Theſe then did breake this command of God, aſwell as the Iewes that admitted them, though the command in your opinion bee given but of them, and it is alſo in part true. And that they did breake this precept, appeares alſo by the example of the burſt, and of the baſtard <note n="ſ" place="margin">Deut. 23. 1, 2.</note>, the commandements are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſame forme, given of them to the Governours, yet bound them of whom given: For God by his prohibition makes them uncapable of ſuch an honour and priviledge, if they ſhould ruſh upon holy things when hee hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted them, their prophaneneſſe and contempt were great. I retort therefore your inſtances thus: The ſtrangers, Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites and Ammonites forbidden theſe holy things, though the precept were of them chiefly, and to the Iewes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally touching them, did prophane them, tranſgreſſe the Law, and did proudly ruſh upon things peculiar, if they meddled therewith: therefore much more the ſervant, though the precept bee of him chiefly, and to his maſter principally concerning him, if hee worke on the Sabbath, prophanes it, tranſgreſſeth the Law, and proudly ruſheth upon the priviledged and peculiar time encloſed by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7551:17"/> Lord of time himſelfe. It is clearely the Lords intent, that the maſter ſhould not ſuffer, nor charge his ſervant to worke this day; and as clearely the Lords meaning, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould not doe his maſters worke that day which is the Lords, and not his maſters day.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, your firſt way of confirming your expoſition was by inſtance; then you goe on to proofes from texts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt taken out of the commandement was taken off in the former Chapter: this is your ſecond proofe built on the text in <hi>Deu.</hi> 5. And here becauſe you flaunt it out in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, and in many of them glance at things as if they made to your purpoſe, beſides the maine of your argument, I thus reply, firſt, to your reaſon drawne from the text: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſome chiefe paſſages in the venting of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the reaſoning is this in briefe: <hi>Moſes applyeth the precept of ſervants reſt, to the maſters that were ſlaves in Egypt, but now ranſomed and ſet in the eſtate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they ſhould allow their ſervants reſt, and make the Sabbath a reſting day, therefore the commandement (thou ſhalt not doe any worke) is given onely to the maſters.</hi> It is applyed to the maſters, therefore given to them, were a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7551:19"/> right conſequence: but therefore to them <hi>onely,</hi> is fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for more is in the conſequent, than was in the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and if you put the word (<hi>only</hi>) into the Antecedent, then both the propoſitions are falſe: For in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 3. as above was ſpecified, <hi>Moſes</hi> applyeth it to children. And the argument is yet unſolid, for it ſtands thus, <hi>Moſes appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in his expoſitions onely to maſters,</hi> therefore <hi>it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely to maſters:</hi> for applications are according to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall occaſions, but not alwaies extended to the utmoſt breadth of the precept, and yet in all this <hi>Moſes</hi> fidelitie no way impeached, inaſmuch as he faithfully applieth where it moſt needeth as occaſion ſerveth (keeping the bounds of truth. Theſe conſequents from this place as you expound it, may be gathered; <hi>therefore that reaſon binds not ſervants,</hi> or this, <hi>therefore the maſter ſinnes moſt ungratefully that will diſturbe his ſervants reſt:</hi> or this, <hi>therefore it is given chiefly to the maſters, as thoſe that muſt not onely keepe, but make a Sabbath;</hi> all which wee yeeld: but the mind that once is big of a new fancy, maketh all that it feedeth upon, nouriſh that fancy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the truth is, the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi> pleades in thoſe words, the reaſon of the right that hee hath to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thy ſervant reſt, who is his freeman by vertue of that redemption; the ſervant as well as the maſter called into the liberty of his holy people, as appeareth in the Preface to the Decalogue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6. bond and free indifferently entertained into the priviledge and honour of the Covenant, and into the band of it: and the reaſon the maſter hath both to obey, and yeeld up his ſervant for that day to Gods commanding and appointing, and alſo to uſe his authoritie for God, in ſeeing that his ſervant keepe the Sabbath: but in other reſpects both maſter and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to rejoyce alike in the great worke of their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but let us examine more narrowly ſome of the ſpeciall paſſages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> addeth in verſ. 14. that thy manſervant and maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7551:20"/> may reſt as well as thou; it is to this (<hi>Thou</hi>) therefore to whom this charge is directed, &amp;c.] Which (<hi>thou?</hi>) that in thoſe words, <hi>thou and thy ſonne.</hi> That makes nothing to the exemption of the ſervant, as thy ſervant from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the firſt <hi>thou,</hi> which is this, <hi>thou ſhalt doe no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worke:</hi> for thy ſervant is one contained under this <hi>thou,</hi> as well as thou art that art the maſter. Or if it bee meant of this firſt <hi>thou,</hi> that were abſonant from the very context. It being meant of the latter <hi>thou,</hi> we muſt ask what you meane when you ſay, it is to this <hi>thou</hi> to whom this charge is directed. Mean you by <hi>charge,</hi> the charge to make the ſervants reſt? That you ſay afterwards were needleſſe, they need but licence, and neither command nor intreat. Or meane you the <hi>charge to give them leave</hi> to reſt? nay, that is againſt your owne reading, the maſter is <hi>to make a day of reſt,</hi> and your owne interpretation, <hi>to make it to be ſo, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not onely to obſerve it himſelfe, but to cauſe others alſo to obſerve it.</hi> Or by <hi>charge,</hi> meane you the command, <hi>Thy ſervant ſhall doe manner of worke;</hi> and this is directed to this <hi>thou;</hi> namely, the maſter of the ſervant? Well, bee it ſo: And what will follow thence? Why ſurely this; <hi>Thou maſter muſt know that God commands thy ſervant to reſt, and thee to make him keepe the Sabbath day:</hi> but not this; <hi>Thou art commanded to reſt, but thy ſervant is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reſt, but may worke if thou biddeſt him, the ſinne and perill is thine only.</hi> What new Divinitie and Logick is this? We ſee then, here is ſome motion in, but no promotion of your cauſe. Nay, becauſe the command is given that the ſervant may reſt as well as the maſter, and that all might be free to attend on Gods ſervice that day alike; therefore it cannot be that the ſervant ſhould remaine bound to the commands of the maſter for ſervile worke on that day.

                  <p>If the commandement of reſt had been directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given to ſervants.] Doth your owne conſcience know and force out this acknowledgement, that it is given to them, though not directly and immediately?</p>
                  <p>Would not ſervants overſet &amp; wearied with ſix daies toile, be of themſelves glad to reſt on the ſeventh] Theſe interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are brought in, to ſet on the proofe, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of reſt was not given at all to ſervants: but how ill they conclude, may bee ſeene by theſe certaine truths. That the ſervant (if not religious, which God lookes not to find, but by his word to make us ſuch)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had rather oft times worke for his maſter, than bee imployed in the duties of ſanctification for a part, much more for all the day: for they are more irkeſome to fleſh and blood, than handy worke. True, that queſtion might take more place, if it were reſt alone that were aymed at, and not reſt for an higher end. That the maſter (if covetous and prophane) will not ſtand upon pleaſing or diſpleaſing God, in requiring ſuch unlawfull worke, but reſpect his gaine more than all, and to the utmoſt call for the ſervants worke that day, when the ſervant in the Court of God and man can have no redreſſe; yea out of irreligious petulancy he will moſt exact worke then. Againe, that the toyled ſervant will be oft ready to worke for himſelfe, as in mending his clothes, or the like; now the maſter is charged to remember the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſlavery, that hee may not dare to overſet his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, No, we doe not; it is impoſed on ſervants, yet not on oxe or aſſe: for the ſervant is forbidden labour, becauſe hee can labour without thee, and ſo hee is capable properly of commandement to reſt; but the Oxe is not forbidden la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but to bee laboured and wrought; for hee cannot worke without thee, and is not capable of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſervant is therefore forbidden labour even in his maſters worke, that hee might bee vacant to holy duties, <note n="n" place="margin">Otio non otio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Zanch. in 4. praecep.</note> not ſo the Oxe. The ſervant is forbidden to bee wrought by his maſter, becauſe now hee muſt acknowledge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maſter, in whoſe ſervice he is this day commanded to worke; with whom there is no reſpect of perſons; and this end, the ſervants obedience to his maſters unlawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of worke that day, would croſſe; <hi>no man can ſerve two maſters.</hi> Moreover, doth God take care for Oxen? No doubt it was written for the ſervants ſake, that he might not attend to guide the Oxes labour, and that mercy due to the Oxe might call for more to man, <hi>Zanchy</hi> is expreſſe, that the commandement was given to the ſervant, hee ſaith; <note n="o" place="margin">Neminem vult excludi a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificatione Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bati: quia tam ſervi, quam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini: tam ſilii, quàm parentes, tam advenae, quám indigenae obſtricti Deo ſunt, natique <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>God would have no man excluded from the ſanctification of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7551:22"/> the Sabbath, becauſe aſwell ſervants as maſters, ſonnes as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſtrangers as home-borne, are bound to God, and borne to his worſhip, touching beaſts there is another reaſon, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Oxe is forbidden to bee wrought, that they might have no ſnare to draw them to worke: and may a ſervant worke at his maſters command? how great a ſnare would this bee to the maſter; who naturally (and ſuch a maſter as will require his ſervant to worke on that day, is not far from his pure naturals) loveth profit more than his ſoule; and feares a penny loſſe, where he thinks it might bee gained, more than the breach of a precept that God threatens with the curſe and hell?

                  <p>Thirdly, and to requite you out of the Text. In the ſame forme of words that the Oxe and Aſſe is prohibited, the ſtranger within the gate of another, is alſo forbidden work, and is it not given to the ſtranger <note n="q" place="margin">It is partly underſtood of the ſtrangers within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, thoſe (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie were commanded ſo to ſanctifie the Sabbath even as other Iewes. <hi>Zanch. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, therefore you muſt know, that the ſame forme of words make not the like bond and obligation in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; nor the precept the ſame: For beſides all that I have ſaid before in chap. 2. 3. The end not only differenceth the precept and proveth it a precept, or a priviledge, as here the end of the Oxes reſt, as reſpecting the Oxe, is meerely reſt; but of the ſervants, chiefely holineſſe, which labour ſervile wholly thwarteth; but alſo the end giveth the precept its modification: for the end of the prohibition of the ſervants labor, being the ſanctification of the day, the ſervant is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bound to reſt and apply himſelfe to holineſſe and the maſter not only not to worke him, or to admoniſh him to ſanctifie the day, but to compell him to the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

                  <p>The labour of the Oxe doth not violate the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sabbath, but you acknowledge, the worke of the ſervant doth, when in the words of the next page (pag. 12.) you ſay thus of the ſervants worke this day, (<hi>the act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, wherewith the commandement of the Sabbath is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the ſervants.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>The Law of nature it ſelfe requireth in general of all men, the ſanctification of times no leſſe than of places, perſons, and things unto Gods honor: for which cauſe God exacts ſome parts of times by way of perpetuall homage, never to bee diſpenſed withall, nor remitted. Of this kind among the Iewes was the Sabbath day, the chiefe &amp; generall feſtivall. Now Nature hath taught the Heathen, and God the Iewes, and Chriſt us (ſaith worthy <note n="x" place="margin">Hooker Eccleſ. pol. l. 5. ſect. 70.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, and howſoever the condition of a ſlave was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than that of an ordinary ſervant, or one hired, yet our queſtion hath been all this while of Iewiſh ſervants, and ſo of Chriſtian ſervants; now the Iew in ſervice might not bee uſed as a ſlave or bond-ſervant, but as an hired ſervant, as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 39, 40.</p>
                  <p>The Iew that was a ſervant, was ſtill a brother in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to be uſed in his ſervice and labour; not ſo the oxe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for the duty of ſubjects to their ſuperiours, to cleare the whole matter, theſe grounds I lay downe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſubjects are bound to obey their ſuperiours onely in thoſe things in which themſelves are ſubjected to their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, &amp; in which the ſuperiors themſelves, are not contrary <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:7551:25"/> reſpect guiltineſſe hath ſomewhat of good in it, and is of God: and in this regard God can ſeparate guilt from ſinne: But partly it followeth ſinne as that which floweth from out of ſinne, and is the deſert and merit of puniſhment, and ſo it participates of the nature of ſinne, and is <hi>quid vitioſum,</hi> a thing vitious: and in this reſpect it cannot bee ſeparated from ſinne. This double conſideration of guiltineſſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in <hi>Rom. 1. 32. We know the judgement of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death.</hi> This is the nature of guiltineſſe, but the forme of ſinne can no way bee ſeparated from ſinne; and yet the ſinne be ſinne: that were a contradiction. The forme of ſinne is in no reſpect good, that were likewiſe a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, beſides this, you ſay firſt; there are two things in every ſinne, the <hi>act</hi> and <hi>guilt,</hi> as the matter and forme; yet in the ſame breath you tell of three things in every ſin, the <hi>Act,</hi> the <hi>Anomy</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Guilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This for the application of your Schoole-termes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>hence,</hi> you ſay, <hi>it appeareth manifeſtly, that his is the guiltineſſe, whoſe the tranſgreſſion is, and his the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to whom the law was preſcribed as a Rule, and that is the maſters, &amp;c.</hi> what coherence is here? <hi>becauſe guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is,</hi> in your ſtile, <hi>the forme of ſinne,</hi> therefore <hi>his is the guiltineſſe whoſe is the tranſgreſſion.</hi> Is guiltineſſe and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion all one, and is not tranſgreſſion the forme of ſinne? This is then in your owne ſenſe, as much as to ſay, his is the ſinne, whoſe is the ſinne. A faire concluſion, but no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile you were thus puzled here, for your reaſoning ſhould thus have runne from your owne grounds: The Act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the commandement of the Sabbath is violated is the ſervants, therefore the guilt is the ſervants; for whoſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olates the Law, hee is guilty; and thus not only the maſter that commands the worke, but the ſervant that doth the work, violating the command of God, is guilty.</p>

               <p>WHereby may eaſily and clearely bee diſcerned the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the equity and wiſdome of Almighty God in the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law of the <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> obliging Parents, and Maſters and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the children, and ſervants and cattell that are merely under their powers; and the raſhneſſe and iniquity of wretched men inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the law as immediatly and directly obliging the children and ſervants themſelves: for (good Sir) conſider it well, and tell me, whether it be more equall to impoſe the law of ceaſing from worke to the ſervants themſelves, or to their maſters in whoſe power they are? Servants are not <hi>homines juris ſut</hi> nor <hi>operum ſuorum domini,</hi> as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers ſpeake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are but their maſters living inſtruments <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tearmeth them, they have no right or power to diſpoſe of themſelves, they cannot play and worke at their owne pleaſure (for this is the condition of freemen, not of ſervants) but are meerely and intirely for bodily labour and ſervice under the power and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of their maſters, and under their power for ſervice onely: in ſuch ſort as they can neither juſtly performe any labour, which their maſters forbid, nor omit any which their Maſters command, but are under their inforcement, and puniſhment alſo if they diſobey. This I ſay is the property and obligation of a ſervant, and that by the <hi>law of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7551:26"/> nations,</hi> which alloweth, and ever hath done, Maſters over their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (as the law of nature doth Parents over their children) not only a directive, but a corrective and coactive power: So then I pray you (tell me) whether the commandement touching the <hi>Sabaoth</hi> was not of common reaſon, rather to be impoſed on them which were at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had power to obey it, than on them which were utterly void and deſtitute of that power, and liberty? Whether in ſuch a caſe it were not more reaſonable to enjoyne the maſters that they ſhould not command, than injoyne the ſervants not to obey? for the poore ſervants, if their maſters command them, could not chuſe but worke, the law of nations bound them unto it, which had put them under their maſters power, and inforcement: but the maſters might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to command, there was no law, that bound them to that, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them to exact ought of their ſervants.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, here begin your reaſons; the firſt whereof is taken from the equitie and wiſedome of God: and it ſtands thus in briefe; <hi>It was more equity and wiſedome to impoſe the commandement on maſters for their ſervants and children, rather than on the children and ſervants themſelves, who are under their maſters power and inforcement.</hi> Therfore what? You leave us to gather up the concluſion, for you may bee aſhamed indeed of the conſequence, which is this; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is againſt Gods wiſedome and equitie to impoſe it on ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children alſo:</hi> it is more wiſedome and equity to doe the one, you ſay, is it therefore againſt wiſedome and equitie to doe the other alſo? If the firſt be more equall and wiſe, the ſecond joyned to the firſt, is of equitie and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and no raſhneſſe nor iniquitie, as you laviſhly terme it. It is given to maſters for their ſervants, you ſay, and rightly, is it therefore not intended to oblige ſervants alſo? Wee grant, it is more equity and wiſedome to impoſe it chiefly on maſters, that they inſnare not the ſervants, and that they provide that the worſhip of God and his religion may bee kept a foot in the family, and all attend on God in the aſſemblies; inſomuch that God will require of them, and the Church alſo, thoſe that are under their charge: and not chiefly on the ſervants who have no authority over
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7551:27"/> others, but are under the authority of another: but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth not the impoſing hereof on the ſervant alſo, who ſhall anſwer for his owne ſoule to God, and cannot bee excuſed by the command of his maſter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but in your diſcourſe divers things ſuffer excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as moſt unſound, as; Firſt, that they are meerely under their maſters power; this confuted before in Chap. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they are under their power for ſervice onely: which is moſt falſe; for in this fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are put under their power directive and coactive for duties of Religion. And this your poſition overthrowes the power of Princes over their ſubjects in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. A wicked doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they cannot juſtly performe any labour their maſters forbid. They may in caſe the maſters life or livelihood be in manifeſt hazzard, by obeying the maſters prohibition, as in <hi>Abigaïls</hi> caſe <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 18, 19.</note>. They may lift their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor out of a pit, or ſave him from ſome imminent danger or loſſe, though the maſter ſhould forbid it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that they may not omit any labour which their maſters command. They may omit the labour which will manifeſtly creeple them, and ought to doe it by vertue of the ſixth Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And ſo that phraſe of yours in pag. 9. l. 7. (overſet with ſixe dayes toyle) if ſpoken as a thing lawfull on the maſters part to overſet his ſervant, is ſinfull. Againe, they may omit the labour that is againſt the commandement of an higher power, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſheweth in his <hi>Summes 22<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. q. 104. art.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that ſervants are vtterly void of power and liberty to obey the commandement of God, in reſting on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath when their maſter bids them worke.</p>
                  <p>This is manifeſtly falſe: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if they are not void of liberty to refuſe workes that will creeple them on any day, then much leſſe are they not void of liberty to refuſe ſuch workes on that day. They are not void of liberty to refuſe ſuch unceſſant imployments as will not give them leave to take breath, in as much as that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7551:27"/> will kill them. Now to worke the ſeventh day too, is to have no time to take breath, as the phraſe is in <hi>Exod. 23. 12. That the ſonne of thy hand-maid and the ſtranger may take breath.</hi> And ſo in the other caſes forementioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they have power to refuſe a thing unlawfull: but the ſervants worke that day is a thing unlawfull: for it is forbidden, as your ſelfe acknowledges.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are here for this day reſtored to freedom, by this that the Lord commands the maſter not to work them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they have no power to ſell themſelves from Gods ſolemne worſhip and ſervice, and ſuch a bargaine is void, if it were made, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> nor did ever the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo bind the ſervant to his maſter, and make him ſo to be his maſters.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if the maſter bid the ſervant do any thing which is either contrary to piety, or repugnant to a ſervants duty, he is not bound to obey <note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Si herus jubeat ſervum aliquid facere, quod aut pietati contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, aut à ſervili officio alienum ſit, non tenetur parere; quia do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus non debuit talia imperare: rectè igitur Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymꝰ hanc ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionem appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, per omnia; nimirum, (inquit ille) in quibus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus carnis, Domino ſpiritus contraria non imperat.

                        </gap>.</note>, becauſe the maſter ought not to command ſuch things. Rightly therefore S. <hi>Hierom</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this exception to the Apoſtles (<hi>In all things</hi>) to wit (ſaith hee) in which the maſter according to the fleſh, doth not command things contrary to the maſter of our ſpirit. Now theſe commands of the maſter are of this nature, and where the maſter ought not to command, the ſervant is not bound to obey; the maſter here, you confeſſe, ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then the ſervant is not bound to obey; and thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a freeman, by your former doctrine the commandement is in force upon him, and hee ſinneth, if he worke at his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters command this day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and as theſe grounds are wicked, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace your argument withall, and therefore do not ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, but weaken your reaſon, ſo where your ground is good, your conſequence is naught. This is indeed true which you ſay, that the maſter hath over his ſervant a coactive and corrective power. But what a miſerable conſequence is this? Maſters have a coactive power; therfore there is no wiſdom, juſtice or equitie in the Almighty to give a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to a ſervant in obeying whereof he is lyable to the ſtripes of a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7551:28"/> wicked maſter. Nay, God requires ſervants to undergoe wrongfull buffetings patiently, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 19. and yet hee is wiſe, and juſt, and equall in ſo doing.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, in this continuance of your former reaſon, partly you charge our doctrine, and partly you cleare your owne. Firſt, you charge ours as occaſioning ſervants diſobedience to their maſters, and ſervants puniſhment by their maſters, and the breach of the Law of nations: but yours, as you ſay, prevents all this. Wee affirme, that the giving of the commandement of the Sabbath to ſervants as well as to maſters, though to maſters as thoſe that ſhould preſerve this Law, if thoſe under them would violate it, occaſioneth none of theſe three evils: Firſt, it occaſioneth not any diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to maſters; for at the moſt it giveth but power to the ſervant ſubmiſſely to refuſe the unlawfull command of his maſter, and not to caſt off ſubjection to his authoritie: to the firſt he is not bound, and therefore is not diſobedient when hee obeyeth not, but on the contrary, if he ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7551:28"/> yeeld to doe the thing that is unlawfull, he is a man pleaſer. And to the ſecond he yeelds himſelfe in his <hi>ſubmiſſe</hi> refuſall, and acknowledgeth his power to the full, when he gives up himſelfe that day to bee commanded by him in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the worſhip of God, in which thing alone God hath allowed the maſter the acting or execution of his power over his ſervant for that day. The reaſon hereof your ſelfe ſuggeſts, when you ſay, the ſervant remaines in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters power no leſſe this day, than any other, but to other and better ends, unto which ends, <hi>viz.</hi> reſpecting the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, you confeſſe the maſters power, for the time, is determined in reſpect of the execution thereof. And who ſeeth not then, that if the execution of their power bee bounded, the ſervant is not to fulfill the boundleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull puttings forth of that power; here it is enough to be a patient meerely, and by no meanes an agent. So then the ſervant remaineth no leſſe in the maſters power, but to higher ends, but more free to Gods ſervice, while the maſter may not call him off by unjuſt exactions. And ſo farre is this from occaſioning any diſobedience, that it occaſioneth, and properly effecteth in the ſervants heart a conſcionable, and produceth in his life an entire and ſinglehearted obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his maſter as to the Lord. Inaſmuch as they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought to the houſe of God where they learn all duty to God and man, though their maſter ſhould bee wicked, and ſo returne to their maſters fruitful, faithfull and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſerving them, not with eye-ſervice, but with all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, to which the feare of God will bind them. But the unfaithfull to God will be unfaithfull to man. Oh the wiſedome of God that provides for particular men and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties by this his Law, better than they could or would for themſelves. Secondly, this occaſioneth not any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wilfully incurred, if then it come, it may patiently, yea, joyfully be borne; for <hi>this is thanke-worthy with God</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 18. 19.</note>. But we ſee by experience, that as religious obſerving the duties of the Sabbath maketh one faithfull in his Calling all the weeke; and as fideli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie is in it ſelfe amiable, and to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7551:29"/> profitable, ſo many evill and covetous maſters will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly chuſe ſuch ſervants, &amp; give them willingly that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the Sabbath, which themſelves care not for, nor feare ſinfully to forgoe. Moreover, if any maſter ſhould beſtow blowes on his ſervant for going to Church, when his maſter on the Sabbath commands him to the works of his calling; this very precept requireth the Magiſtrate to relieve the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant againſt the injury of a wicked maſter, when it giveth the Magiſtrate charge to ſee the Sabbath kept by all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his gate, and the ſupreme Magiſtrate to puniſh the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magiſtrates neglects, or injuſt impoſitions, as wee ſee in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who contended with the Nobles for propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sabbath by unjuſt impoſitions of worke upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.

                  <p>Thirdly, for the Law of Nations, if you take it ſtricktly and properly, it is ſimply and univerſally a poſitive Law, as ſaith <hi>Iohn de Salas</hi>

It is that which al Nations wel-ordered, do uſe: for uſe requiring, and humane neceſſities, Nations of men have ordained to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certaine Rites or Lawes.

Now that the impoſing of this commandement of the Sabbath on ſervants alſo ſhould occaſion the breach of the Law of Nations is a meere pretence: for the Law of Nations could never charge ſervants with ſuch a ſubjection as ſhould croſſe and caſt out the worſhip of God, ſo that the ſervant ſhould be ſo obliged to his maſter, that of conſcience and neceſſity the ſervant of a wicked maſter muſt bee left in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7551:29"/> condition, wherein he ſhould never have power to frequent the ſolemne worſhip of God, as will of neceſſity follow, if he be alwayes, abſolutely, as you teach, his maſters. Shew me whether ever the Nations generally, nay, ever any one Nation well ordered, gave ſuch a Law? If no ſuch Law or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, it is no way of the Law of Nations: if not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is much more abſonant from Natures inſtinct. I ſay, ſuch a thing could never poſſibly be found among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, it is ſo abhorring to Nature: but if men could ſo farre and ſo univerſally degenerate, yet this without all controverſie determines this caſe: <note n="u" place="margin">Ius Gentium quum ſit poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, non poteſt derogare juri na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae. Ioh. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las tract. de leg. q. 91. diſp. 2. ſect. 5.</note> the Law of Nations being a poſitive Law and humane, though brought in by the cuſtome of Nations, cannot, nor muſt derogate from a Law of Nature. Now the Law of Nature binds all men, even ſervants as ſervants to ſerve God ſolemnely on the times he ſhall call for their homage from them indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as on this day he doth, and to this end to be vacant and free from bodily labours that are ſervile for that time. The Decalogue is the Law of Nature, it chargeth ſervants in the fourth and fifth Commandements; the duties there requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervants ſtand bound unto, and to them firſt as the rules of the Law of Nature, to other duties after, under, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them, if any ſuch be agreed upon, and conſtituted by the Nations: but if Nations ſhould conſtitute any thing againſt any duty in the ten Commandements, it is not a Law: for that is no Law which is not juſt <note n="x" place="margin">Ius non eſt, quod non eſt juſtum &amp; rectum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> non lex ſed faex: non lex, ſed labes: non lex ſed lis.</note> and right; it is perverſeneſſe, no Law: it is not Law, but lees, but ſtrife, but a deſtroyer, but error, but tiranny, any thing rather than Law, as all the learned conclude. If you, or any can ſhew ſuch a Law, or rather lees of Nations, bleſſed be God in his wiſedome, juſtice and equity for ever, who by his eternall Law freeth poore ſervants from ſuch tyrannous exact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as our doctrine is wine that comes of the pure grape, ſo yours is the poyſon of Dragons preſſed from the vine of Sodome: for I affirme, that it produceth all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evils: For this, That the ſervant is left, even the Sabbath day alſo meerely in his maſters power to be obedient to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7551:30"/> his commands for ſervile works; firſt, it would occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the ſervant through bitterneſſe of ſoule ariſing from an unſupportable burden; ſecondly, and ſo from thence juſt puniſhment on the ſervant, if the maſters ſtrength can reach them to inflict it, or from ſuperiour Magiſtrates; and thirdly, evert the Law of Nations, by ſtriking at the life of Religion and Societies in the firſt and fundamentall ſociety, <hi>viz.</hi> a family; and in one of the moſt neceſſary props of that ſociety, <hi>viz.</hi> maſter and ſervant. From this likewiſe it will follow, that God ſhall be neglected by the ſervant, through neglect of holineſſe, and that the ſervant of an unjuſt maſter ſhall no way be provided for, in reſpect of his refreſhing, no not ſo well as the oxe or aſſe: for God will be the avenger of that injuſtice, his poore creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercileſly uſed, but for this, God, you ſay, provides, that the ſervant muſt of conſcience obey, and ſo Gods juſtice, wiſedome, goodneſſe, and the ends of giving the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in regard of the ſervant ſhall bee impeached, and wholly fruſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, you overthrow your owne Tenet: for if the execution of that power be bounded for that day, as you rightly teach, how is the ſervant to obey the unjuſt uſage of their power? For if hee have no power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the ſervant may refuſe to obey, and muſt, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this reſpect the ſervant is made a freeman, and ſo under the obligation of Gods command by your owne confeſſion; and <note n="y" place="margin">Quiſque ex tharitate propria tenetur non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſine gravi cauſa.

I ſay, therefore if the maſters power be determined, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is freed; but if he have power, how is it notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding herein determined? Againe, if the maſter muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge the ſervant of worke, but in ſtead thereof charge him to the exerciſes of holineſſe; the ſervant muſt needs in obeying his maſters ſinfull command of working, flee off
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7551:30"/> from his charge and power, to charge him at that time of his ſo labouring, in the duties of holineſſe, ſeeing no man can doe two things (chiefly of this nature) at once.</p>

For ſuppoſe his maſter injoyne him ſome worke on the <hi>Sabaoth</hi> day (covetous maſters may ſoone doe it) eſpecially if they thinke that precept touching their ſervants ceſſation, not to touch them) or elſe they may bee ignorant of the law of God, (as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> may happily ſerve <hi>Pagans</hi>) Admit I ſay ſome Maſter commands his ſervant to work on the <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> what ſhould the ſervant doe, ſhould he worke? God hath forbidden him; ſhould he not worke? His maſter hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him: for the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is ſet at ſtrife with the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nations,</hi> and that poore ſervant like the Sailor betweene <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdit,</hi> ſtandeth perplexed and afflicted in the midſt betweene ſtripes and ſinne: for he muſt of neceſſity either diſobey Gods commandement, which is ſinne; or his Maſters, which is attended with ſtripes.

But that is not the point I ſtand upon; the point is how it agreeth with the tender goodneſſe, and compaſſion of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God towards poore ſervants (whoſe condition is yet honeſt and

                  <p>Firſt, here I have to ſay againſt both the manner and the maine of your arguing: For the manner; firſt, you play the Sophiſter egregiouſly, the queſtion is, whether it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely to maſters, and not to ſervants? And you take the riſe of your reaſoning from hence, that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (according to our opinion) is given to ſervants only, and not to maſters; and therefore you talke (that you might put a gloſſe upon your reaſoning, and make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appeare the more foule, of the commandement of the ſervants ceſſation, not touching the maſter. <hi>The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to themſelves, not to their maſters?</hi> This is meere cavilling: for who ever thought or dreamt, ſave your ſelfe, much leſſe held, that the commandement was not given to their maſters, though it were given to the ſervants alſo. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, you ſeeme to promiſe the ſervant liberty, but indeed make him the bond-ſlave to his maſters unlawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and while you would free him from blowes of an injurious maſter, you free him (if it may bee called free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) from the ſervice of God, which is perfect freedome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the maine of your reaſon, it is thus: to give the commandement to ſervants alſo, is againſt the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God; for it caſts the ſervant upon ſtripes or ſinne: I anſwer: Doth the commandement caſt any upon ſinne? If it any way provoke, or revive ſinne, it is by accident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſpirituall, juſt, and good Law meets with a carnall heart, ſold under ſinne <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 11, 12.</note>. Sinne <hi>taketh occaſion</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7551:31"/> the commandement doth not <hi>cauſe</hi> ſinne. Had you had <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit, you would have juſtified the Law, and laid load upon the fleſh and corrupt nature as <hi>out of meaſure ſinfull,</hi> and have adviſed all youth to cleanſe their wayes by taking heed thereto according to Gods word <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 9.</note>: and not goe about to fill greene heads with crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets. Yea, but if they ſinne not, but obey, ſtripes attend them, and this is againſt the mercy of God. Indeed? Is this your ſtumbling blocke? It is then againſt his goodneſſe that <hi>Hagar</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, and for a recompence, when you talke ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of miſchiefes and inconveniences, free your Doctrine of them if you can. For if the ſervant muſt obey his maſters unlawfull commands of worke on that day, I ſay, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, but he falleth into miſchiefe; for he is ſold from Gods ſervice and the Covenant of God, (<note n="p" place="margin">Eſay 56. 6.</note>

The ſervant therefore doing that worke on the Sabaoth day in obedience to his maſter, which of his owne will and election he would not do, although the worke whereby the commandement of God is tranſgreſſed, be in ſome ſort his, yet the tranſgreſſion is none of his, but his maſters, that exacted the worke, ſo that although the worke as <hi>naturally</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red be the ſervants, yet morally it is the Maſters; The labour of it is the ſervants, but the ſinne of it is the Maſters: for the ſinne is not the ſervants obedience to the Maſters commandement, but in the maſters diſobedience to Gods commandement, which hath indeed prohibited the worke of ſervants in the Sabaoth, but yet the prohibition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and directed to their Maſters not to them, who are onely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, not authors of their owne labours; now in the imputation of ſinne, difference is to be made betwixt the <hi>authors</hi> and the <hi>miniſters</hi> Betwixt the <hi>principall,</hi> and <hi>inſtrumentall</hi> agents.</p>

                  <p>Let the reader remember, that you here yeeld, that <hi>if the commandement be impoſed on ſervants, then they ſinne in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this day at their maſters command.</hi> Now this hitherto hath been proved, and all plainly anſwered that may ſeeme to make againſt it: and ſo I proceed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the worke forbidden is; Firſt, ſervice, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the ſixe daies; <hi>Six daies ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſervile worke, in which, and about which the meſſenger is imployed; ſo the notation of the word in the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which you cite doth properly ſignifie. Thirdly, all <hi>thy</hi> worke: as oppoſed to workes of ſanctification, that is, of piety and mercy properly, though they bee not ſervile worke properly ſo called, or mechanicall, as the ſtudy and exerciſe of the Liberall Arts; for theſe concerne naturall and civill things, and looke not immediatly to the worſhip of God, nor the unavoidable neceſſities of man. It is apparant then, that ſervile workes, or workes of miniſtry about our callings, and ſo ſervants worke, is in a ſpeciall manner prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. Now then take your owne argument. The worke permitted on the ſixe daies, is prohibited the ſeventh; the <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:7551:34"/> in ſenſe with the middle word, with which it is the ſelfe ſame in ſound. If the firſt, then it is oppoſed to all that dutie of the Sabbath which conſiſts in the immediate honour of God, done with the full complacency of hart therein, and the honorable mention of it in our words and diſcourſe, as is cleare in the Text to him that duly weigheth it. Now ſay, Is not the ſervants conteined in this word (<hi>thy pleaſure</hi>) as that which is no duty of Gods worſhip, publike or private? If the ſecond, then it is not al that is forbidden (and ſo your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument falſ; but rather concernes (as many learned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Divines deliver our works of recreation, or ſports which <hi>we finde out,</hi> though at other times lawfull, which take off the heart from holy duties; for God hath found us another recreation; chiefely on that day, <hi>if any will be merry, let him ſing Pſalmes</hi> (as in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92. The Title compared with the Pſalme) &amp; would have the Sabbaths duties our delight.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Now whereas you lay this for a ground, that the election of mans will is the proper forme of actuall ſin, I wonder how you ſhould ſo miſtake, but that Divinity was not your covenanted Wife, but only your Concubine, which for a turne you uſe, and in the uſe you raviſh. Ataxy or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity is the proper forme of ſinne actuall, be the Ataxy in thoughts, in deſires, in deeds, or in words. Moreover, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the will is an act, and good, and therefore by no meanes the forme of ſinne: and if you ſay, you ſpeake not of election, but this election, namely, the unruly and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate election; tell me, is the election or the unrulineſſe the forme of ſinne; unrulineſſe doubtleſſe, which informeth both the election that is ſinnefull, and the action that is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And whereas you ſay, that outward unlawfull actions are but expreſſions of ſinne, and not ſinne properly; if they bee unlawfull actions, they bee ſinnefull actions properly ſo called, for you yeelded before, according to the truth of Scripture, and reaſon (pag. 12.) that ſinne formally is nothing elſe but unlawfulneſſe: unleſſe you will ſay, that ſinne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally is not ſinne properly: A proper poſition.</p>

Now from this it followeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that not onely in lying the tongue is abuſed, as the ſenſeleſſe creature is abuſed by a ſinner, but (inaſmuch as the body and ſoule are but one man, and make one perſon whoſe are the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Secondly, and for objecting, firſt, I would retort upon you your owne argument: if the naturall inſtrument, that in your opinion ſinneth not, (as the tongue lying, lyeth not, a ſottiſh ſpeech) yet it is charged with ſinne in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is puniſhed for ſinne here, and hereafter, and is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſinne: then how much more is the voluntary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument charged, polluted, and ſhall be puniſhed, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke in evill, but muſt needs bring will to the worke, and election too in ſome ſort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for your objection and ſolution: the objection is this, <hi>The ſervant is a voluntary inſtrument, not ſo the eye, or hand in the body; therefore from the hand</hi> to the ſervant will not hold. You ſolve and ſalve it thus; The ſervant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth will, but thus and thus; as a conditionall will, a wil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, not ſelfe-electing, a will to the work, not to the ſin; therefore a naturall inſtrument and ſuch a voluntary are all one. This can never bee made good; for by your owne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7551:36"/> confeſſion, ſuch an inſtrument is in part voluntary, and ſo is not the naturall inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the maine of your anſwer lyeth in this, that to obey the maſter in his worke, and not in his ſinne, is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; you yeeld then that if it be a ſinne; no conditionall or halfe-election will ſerve to free him, that ſo chuſeth it, from being a ſinner. I urge not onely the maſters commanding of worke that day is ſinne, but the worke of the maſter that day is forbidden to be done, and ſo is ſinne. There the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, halfe, or under will, the obeying will of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant (if he worke) will not excuſe him from ſinne. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing taketh away voluntarineſſe from a deed, but abſolute violence of compulſion, and a meere caſualty that could not be foreſeene or foreheeded. As if one be compelled to bend the knee (by force his knee bowed by others) before an Idoll; or if one kill another by meere chance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5, 6, 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for that ſpeech where you ſay, <hi>The worke on the Sabbath hath ſinne annexed to it,</hi> it is not right; for the worke on the Sabbath is ſinne, that circumſtance of time, <hi>on the Sabbath,</hi> is the forme of it. And this indeed muſt bee divided betweene the maſter and the ſervant, as both their ſinnes; the maſters in commanding, the ſervants in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But to divide ſinne from ſervile worke on the Sabbath that they ſhould not meet in the ſame perſon, neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor ſervant, nor all the oxen in the Gate are able with Cart-ropes to doe. I pray you note; <hi>the worke</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is the ſervants, the ſinne is the maſters.</hi> Why, the worke is the ſinne, and is it not the ſervants then?</p>

Of the firſt ſort of workes they are only Miniſters, of the ſecond they are Authors. And touching this ſecond ſort I confeſſe (although of the former it bee farre otherwiſe) both that ſervants have a ſeverall obligation of their owne, and that their tranſgreſſion and ſinne is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, and therefore that themſelves are bound to anſwere it to the juſtice of God, but whether the ſinne of theſe ſecond workes, be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly the ſervants, or that the Maſter alſo participates with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in that guiltineſſe. It may be a queſtion, for if they be done meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſervants election (beſide the knowledge and contrary to the commandement of his maſter) it ſeemes to be particularly the ſervants ſinne. But if they bee occaſioned by the maſters negligence, then doth he certainly participate in guiltineſſe with his ſervant although in a diverſe ſort, for it is a ſinne of commiſſion in the ſervant doing an unlawfull act, and a ſinne of omiſſion in the Maſter neglecting his due care, becauſe by the precept of Almighty God the maſter is bound not only to command his ſervant to worke, but to command him not to worke on the Sabaoth day: well then the workes, which ſervants doe on the Sabaoth day on their owne election, are condemned: the workes they doe by obedience, are excuſed by their maſters comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; but what workes are ſo excuſed? Are all? No; but briefly all thoſe which while they are performed as by the Servants of men, they that doe then are not impeached for being the ſervants of God. That is to ſay, the workes of <hi>labour,</hi> but not the workes of <hi>ſinne:</hi> for to the firſt they are obliged by the law of <hi>nations,</hi> but the ſecond are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them by the Law of God, not nakedly forbidden as their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on the Sabaoth is but <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediatly</hi> forbidden them, for it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7551:37"/> them forbidding thoſe things that by their property and nature, or (as the Schoolemen ſay) <hi>exſuogenere,</hi> are evill; but the commandement that forbiddeth ſervile workes on the Sabaoth is of a different ſort; firſt becauſe the ſervant is, touching the matter which it forbiddeth (<hi>labour</hi>) wholly ſubject to another mans command: ſecondly, becauſe the commandement forbiddeth not the ſervant to worke, but onely forbiddeth the Maſter his ſervants worke; thirdly, becauſe the thing it ſelfe, namely, ſervants labour, is not evill materially and <hi>exſuogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> as the matters of the other negative commandements are: but only circumſtantially, becauſe its done upon ſuch a day: for idolatry, blaſphemy, diſhonouring of Parents, murther, adultery, theft, falſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, coveting of that is other mens; which are the matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandements, are evill in their owne nature; and therefore forbidden becauſe they are evill in their owne nature: But to labour on the Sabaoth is not by nature evill, but therefore evill becauſe it is forbidden. So that the native ilneſſe in the other cauſeth the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but the prohibition in this cauſeth the evill, for laboring on the ſeventh day; if God had not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had not bin evil at al (no more than to labour on the ſixt, as not being interdicted by any law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the matters of all the other commandements are: for although the ſecret inſtinct of nature teacheth all men, that ſometime is to bee withdrawne from their bodily labours, and to be dedicated to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God (which even the prophaneſt Gentiles, amidſt all the blind ſuperſtition, and darkeneſſe, wherewith they were covered, in ſome ſort did) appointing ſet times to be ſpent in ſacrifice and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their idols, which they tooke for their Gods, yet to obſerve one day in the number of ſeven, as a certaine day of that number, and namely, the ſeventh in the ranke, or a whole day by the revolution of the Sunne, and with that ſevere exactneſſe of reſtraining all worke (as was injoyned to the Iewes) is but meerely ceremoniall, brought in by poſitive Law; and is not of the law of nature. For had that forme of keeping Sabaoth, bin a law of nature, then had it obliged the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſeeing they participate both equall in the<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 13.

               <p>To turne to the point and clearely to determine it; the maſter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is accountable unto God, for the ſervants worke done on the <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth:</hi> but for what worke? Namely, for all the workes of labour, but not for the workes of ſin: and how for the workes of labour? Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if hee doe them not abſolutely, of his owne election, but reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as of obedience to his maſters command; for touching labours, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are directly obliged to their maſters. But touching ſinnes, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are obliged immediatly to God. Therefore thoſe they may doe becauſe their maſter commands them: theſe they may not doe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though commanded) becauſe God forbids them.</p>
               <p>The ſervants then may not in any caſe, ſinne at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Maſter on earth: becauſe hee hath received immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a direct commandement to the contrary, from his Maſter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: For it is better to obey God than man. And there is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the duties which they owe as ſervants to their maſters according to the fleſh: &amp; which they owe as <hi>Children</hi> to the father of ſpirits: or betwixt the obligation wherein they ſtand to men, who have power but over their bodies in limited caſes, and that for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And that infinite obligation wherein they ſtand to him that is both creator, and preſerver, and redeemer, and ludge of body and ſoule; ſinne therefore they may not, if their <hi>Maſters</hi> command them, becauſe God hath forbidden them (nor only forbidden, I ſay, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it them) but labour they may if their maſters command them, becauſe God hath no way forbidden them that; God hath indeede forbidden the Maſters exacting that worke on the Sabaoth; but hee hath not forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſervants execution of that work if it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or exacted: he hath reſtrained the maſter from commanding it, but hee hath not reſtrained the ſervants from obeying if it bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for although I acknowledge the ſervants worke on the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth to imply ſinne: yet I ſay it is not the ſervants fault. And albeit I confeſſe the commandement of God be tranſgreſſed, and God diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by ſuch workes on the Sabaoth, yet it is not the ſervant that tranſgreſſeth the commandement, it is not he that diſobeyeth God. For the queſtion is not the <hi>paſſive</hi> ſenſe, whether God bee diſpleaſed with theſe workes, but of the <hi>active</hi> who diſpleaſeth him. The thing is confeſſed, but the perſon is queſtioned. Confeſſed, that is, that there is ſinne committed in that worke, but queſtioned whoſe ſinne it is. For worke having relation both to the Maſter and to the ſervant: to the Maſters commanding and to the ſervants executing; I affirme that <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:7551:38"/> were given more to ſervants than to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and croſſeth your former words, where you ſay, <hi>their labour is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> for if they labour, is it not their labour, and ſo on the contrary? Or to the words (<hi>directly and immediately?</hi>) you yeeld then, that ſervants labour is forbidden indirectly and immediately. The truth is, that which is <hi>nakedly</hi> forbidden, is <hi>directly</hi> forbidden: and that which is <hi>immediately</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, is ſinfull to be done, though <hi>mediately:</hi> mediately or immediately takes not away the edge of the precept, or power of the commander.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>The other commandements were impoſed without ſpecification or exception of any perſon whatſoever, and therefore hold all men under an equall obligation; but this not ſo. Anſw.</hi> What arguing is this? This commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with ſpecification, and the ſervant is ſpecified, and his worke of ſervice to his maſter on the Sabbath ſpecified and prohibited, therefore it bindeth him not, it is not his ſinne. Nay, the ſpecification maketh it the more his ſinne, and God provided by this enumeration of the perſons, (as all have and will agree, unleſſe any ſhould uſe your falſe glaſſe) that this reſt might by no meanes be violated. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Atterſoll</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Vpon Numb. chap. 28. verſ. 11, 12, 13. p. 1142.</note> ſaw in this enumeration not a freeing of the ſervants and ſubjects from the obligation, becauſe a charge is laid on the Governours to ſee that others keepe the day: but a reaſon to perſwade the inferiour the more chearefully to keepe it: thus he ſaith; <hi>The charge is laid on Governours, that inferiours might yeeld chearefully to Gods will, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how ſtrait a charge God hath given to all Governours.</hi> And that he meant by Gods will, the commandement here impoſed upon, and binding ſervants from doing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters worke, though commanded, is apparant by his words in the ſame place, which runne thus: <hi>Many fathers urge their children, many maſters command their ſervants to goe about their owne buſineſſe, and ſend them from place to place at that time, when they ſhould attend to the holy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, whereas both of them might well and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               </p>
               <p>That word (<hi>exception</hi>) is venemous, as if ſome perſons were excepted by that ſpecification of perſons in the fourth Commandement: theſe are <hi>cankred</hi> words and <hi>evill</hi> that will quickly <hi>corrupt good manners.</hi> Therefore Chriſtian Reader, I give thee this note as an Antidote; and that it may be the more ſtrong to expell poyſon, know that the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of perſons in a precept negative, cannot be an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe parties from under that precept, if ſpecified in the prohibition, not excepted. And for the equall obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that holds all men alike under the other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is the ſame alſo in this: for if you ſay the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement more obligeth Governours, I anſwer; It doth ſo in reſpect of their <hi>politicall</hi> obſerving of the command, as they are Governours, and ſo ought to ſee this Law kept, and not violated: and thus they are bound more, and otherwiſe than other men to every of the other nine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the Magiſtrate is the keeper, or preſerver of both <note n="m" place="margin">Cuſtos utriuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tabulae.</note> Tables of the Law. But in reſpect of their <hi>perſonall</hi> obſervance hereof, it is equally charged on them, as on the ſervant and ſubject: and ſo it is alſo in the reſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you ſay, this commandement is of a different ſort from others, therefore it otherwiſe obligeth, and you give three things to ſhew this difference; firſt, the nature of it; ſecondly, the matter prohibited; thirdly, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the nature of this Law, you ſay, <hi>It is a Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Tables of ſtone,</hi> but <hi>not on the Tables of mens heart, nor any Law of nature.</hi> You make this diſtinction, that there are revealed Lawes in the Decalogue which are not the ſecret Lawes of Nature, the Lawes ingraven in ſtone by the ſinger of God, were not all of them the Lawes of Nature.</p>
               <p>Againſt this I preſſe you with reaſons, authorities, and <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:7551:39"/> 
                  <hi>of the other Commandements in the nature and property of the things,</hi> as you ſay, and ſo you give three inſtances; two of them have been already anſwered, namely, that the labour of the ſervant is wholly ſubject to another mans command, and that the commandement only forbiddeth the maſter his ſervants worke. The third difference (which now we will, God willing, ſcanne) is this, <hi>That the thing forbidden, viz.</hi> ſervile worke, and ſo the ſervants worke, <hi>is not evill materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,, and</hi> ex ſuo genere, <hi>as the matter of other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is, nor evill of its owne nature, but onely becauſe it is prohibited, and therefore,</hi> you hold, <hi>it is no Law of nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here firſt conſider how farre wide this is to your ſcope, and the queſtion in hand: for what if the matter prohibited be evill but onely by prohibition; would not that prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make it ſinfull of lawfull, and that to the ſervant? Ile give you an inſtance in a precept ceremoniall: God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that no leaven ſhould be in their houſes during the Feaſt of unleavened bread: ſuppoſe the maſter ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſervant to make in thoſe dayes leavened bread, if the ſervant did it, the ſervant ſinned as well as his maſter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the propoſition it ſelfe is faulty: for the matter of the ſecond Commandement is not evill <hi>materially,</hi> any more than the matter of the fourth, to make an image or likeneſſe of any thing in heaven, earth, or ſea, is not evill, but onely <hi>circumſtantially,</hi> as to make it to bow to it. If you ſay, to make it to bow to it, is the matter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: (as indeed it is) then I ſay, to worke on the Sabbath, is the matter of this Commandement; and as to make an image to bow to it, is evill materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and of its owne nature, ſo to ſpend (the Sabbath I ſay not, <hi>that ſeventh day,</hi> but) the Sabbath, the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of Gods worſhip in our labour, is evill <hi>materially.</hi> And therefore the maſters command cannot excuſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants worke that day. And now hence I further reaſon againſt you thus: Though the ſecond Commandement forbid to make images, which is not evill in it ſelfe, but onely with this circumſtance added, to make them to bow to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7551:39"/> them; yet he that maketh them for another that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will worſhip them, breaketh the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therefore in this Commandement, the ſervant that worketh at his maſters commandement, whom he knoweth to abuſe his labour in this kind, breaketh this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now by your Rule, the ſervant commanded to make an image, which he knoweth his maſter would abuſe to worſhip it, ought to make it, becauſe to make a likeneſſe or image is not ſimply evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when you hold, that the Law of Nature is of thoſe things only that are evill by their property and nature, this paſſage received thruſts out the ſecond commandement from being a Law of Nature, according to your expoſition of a thing that hath in it native ilneſſe: for to make an image (ſetting aſide the circumſtance) to bow to it, is no more evil, than for a ſervant to worke, ſetting aſide this circumſtance (on the Sabbath.) This your ſlye arguing ſavours of Popery, which hath thruſt out the ſecond Commandement as a poſitive and ceremoniall Law upon the ſame grounds.</p>
               <p>And when you ſay, that the prohibition of other things is cauſed by their native illneſſe; if you meane, their illneſſe was before the Law (not underſtanding by Law, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation thereof, but the Law of Nature written in the heart of man, inaſmuch as this Law is the expreſſe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God) it is a blaſphemous Tenet, for hereby tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion ſhall bee where there is no Law, and a chiefe evill, a <hi>ſummum malum,</hi> as well as a chiefe good, or an abſolute goodneſſe out of God, which this illneſſe ſwerveth from. For my part, I cannot tell how any thing ſhould bee evill natively, but evill, becauſe it is defective of good, which good perfecting man is the Law of righteouſneſſe. If by prohibition, you meane the promulgation of the Law, then I ſay, that this maketh not the thing prohibited unlawfull, but onely makes the ſinne the greater in them that yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, after God by lively voyce hath renewed thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated precepts, offuſcated with ſinne in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Commandement it ſelfe in theſe five things</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:7551:40"/> (you ſay) <hi>is meerely Ceremoniall, brought in by poſitive Law; and is not of the Law of Nature; firſt, to obſerve one day in ſeven; ſecondly, to obſerve a certaine day of that number; thirdly, to obſerve the ſeventh in the ranke; fourthly, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a whole day by the revolution of the Sunne; fifthly, to obſerve it with ſevere exactneſſe of reſtraining all worke.</hi> This you eſſay to prove, firſt, by a place of Scripture; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the example of the Patriarchs; and thirdly, by the abſurditie that elſe will follow.</p>
               <p>This matter ſhall bee more largely diſcuſſed, becauſe it will much cleare the Doctrine of the Sabbath; for now you ſtrike at the roote of it, and would lay Religion on the ground: but your owne ſtaffe will breake your backe, which you give by the handle into our hands. This you yeeld, that the ſecret inſtinct of nature hath taught all men, even the prophaneſt Gentiles, that ſome time is to be ſet apart, and dedicated to the ſolemne worſhip of God, as ſet times to be ſpent in ſacrifice and devotion. Now goe on; this inſtinct is the Law written in their hearts; therefore the Sabbath is a Law of Nature. But did this inſtinct of Nature guide them to your former five particulars about the time of worſhip? If it did, and that the ſheards hereof are found among the Gentiles, you cannot, nor any other for you conclude (unleſſe you will play the mad-men with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) that every of them hath leſſe than moralitie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie in it. It is true, the Gentiles a thouſand wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved the uſe of the Sabbath, by keeping holyday to their Idols, ſaith <hi>Aretius</hi>

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7551:42"/>
               <p>Againe, hee helpeth us to another authoritie out of <hi>loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> in his ſecond booke againſt <hi>Appain,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Neither is there any city of the Grecians, or Barbarians, nor any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to whom the cuſtome of the ſeventh day, in which wee reſt, hath not come.</hi> A pregnant proofe. But <hi>Gomarus</hi> ſaith, there are words foregoing which doe end the controverſie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe, <hi>Moreover the people doe now much emulate our pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Which words (ſaith he) do only ſhew, that the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath among the Gentiles, was only an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes by Proſelites, and perchance many others. What? were all the Gentiles Eaſt and Weſt, become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes; or would all of them admit a meere ceremony? Some Nations beſides Proſelytes, admitted Circumciſion: but did all the cities of Greeks and Barbarians admit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? And if they imitated their piety, could it bee thought that they imitated it as theirs, and not rather as that which their naturall light glimmeringly guided them unto; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing the Iewes were naturally hated of all people.</p>
               <p>For his quotation out of <hi>Theodoret upon the 20. chap. of Ezekiel,</hi> to teſtifie to his tenet, who ſaith, <hi>That in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath, the Iewes ſeemed to obtaine a certaine proper commonwealth; for no other Nation did obſerve this reſt, and neither did Circumciſion ſo diſtinguiſh them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as did the Sabbath.</hi> I anſwer: This cannot bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of any kind of obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for then <hi>Theodoret</hi> muſt ſpeake directly againſt all received teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of antiquity (which may not bee thought) but of the true obſerving thereof in the ſolemne rituall worſhip of God, which being all publike and ſolemnely uſed on that day, as the ſanctification thereof, did aſmuch more lively di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Iewes, Gods people; from the Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than did circumciſion; as the whole Law doth more than any one part thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus wee have made good the ſufficiency of the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions excepted againſt, wee leave them therefore with the reſt fore-alleaged to be cavilled at by the next that dares to attempt it.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7551:42"/>
               <p>The infirmeneſſe of the conſequence (ſaith <hi>Gomarus</hi>) is this, that if the obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gontiles,</hi> yet from thence no ſuch antiquity of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> may bee evinced, but only thence appeareth the imitation of the Iewes by the Gentiles, as by Proſelytes and others perhaps. I anſwer, the conſequent is firme, for the former Heathen Authors have no reference to the Iewes, and the Gentiles derided the Iewiſh Sabbathes, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it came up among the Gentiles by imitation of the Iewes, yet this ſpreading of it farre and wide, prooveth the goodnes of the conſequence, that it is of the moral Law. For hence it ſufficiently appeares, that the inſtitution of a ſet ſeventh day in the weeke is immutable, and not ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and temporall; not proper to the Iewes onely, but common to all, ſeeing nature apprehends it meet and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that we often exerciſe the worſhip of God, and cannot but acknowledge (as we ſee in the inclination of the whole univerſe of men) that this weekely determination of a day is moſt convenient, and altogether abſolute.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the anſwer to your poſition, determining what is ceremoniall in the fourth commandement. Your proofe for the ceremony of it in thoſe reſpects, is, firſt, taken from Texts of Scripture in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12, 20. Hence you reaſon thus; <hi>That forme of keeping Sabbath was given to the Iewes, as a ſpeciall marke of their ſeparation from Gentiles, and conſecration to God; therfore it was meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremoniall, and obliged not the Gentiles; which it had done, if it had beene a Law of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, here your conſequence is weake and fallacious: for every marke and ſigne of ſeparation from others, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to God, is not ceremoniall. Baptiſme is ſuch a marke betweene Perſian and Heathens, yet no ceremony; ſo is the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper. Such was the Sabbath then, and is at this day.</p>
               <p>Neither doth every marke of ſeparation and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oblige only thoſe that have that marke: for the duty <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

Exod. 16. 6.</note>, of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Iſraelites before the Law, by whom the dayes were gathered into weekes, which ſheweth, that the obſervation of the Sabbath was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you urge us with an abſurditie that will follow on this doctrine, that if it bee of Nature to keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, it bindeth us Chriſtians to keepe <hi>the ſeventh day</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſo the firſt changers of the day to the firſt day of the weeke ſinned grievouſly. This argument is of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: for the firſt day of the weeke is now the Lords Sabbath, as the ſeventh day from the Creation was then. And thus neither Law of Nature broken, nor ſinne incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore all abſurditie avoided: the firſt day of the weeke is alſo <hi>the</hi> ſeventh, though not <hi>that</hi> ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>This accommodation alſo of the fourth precept to the Iewes in the determination of the day maketh not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ceremoniall, nor yet the change of it to our Lords day, no more than the fifth Commandement is made ceremoniall by this promiſe, reſpecting Iſrael in Canaan, <hi>That thy dayes may bee long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> And this change in the application of the precept by the Apoſtle, <hi>that it may bee well with thee, and that thou mayeſt live long on earth</hi>

               <p>It ſtanding firme then, that the Commandement in every part thereof, as it is contained in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> is morall, and of the Law of Nature, and the breach thereof a ſinne, your concluſion taketh place againſt you, namely, that the ſervant may not in any caſe worke on the Sabbath at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited workes (becauſe it is ſinne) at the commandement of any maſter on earth: <hi>For it is better to obey God than man.</hi> To the Anſwer whereof I leave you, or others that in pride of ſpirit, and a ſpirit of contradiction dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it in your behalfe.

               <p>BVt there is another objection, for admit the ſervants, worke upon the Sabaoth be the Maſters ſinne, that impoſeth it. Is it not ſinne to give conſent and furtherance to another mans ſinne? But this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants doe when they execute their Maſters commandements, and conſequently it is unlawfull ſo to yeeld; lawfull therefore it is to reſiſt and reject ſuch commandement. I anſwer, firſt touching the point of conſenting, that in ſuch a worke is to be conſidered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and the <hi>quality,</hi> that is the worke it ſelfe and the ſinfulneſſe of it, ſervants may conſent to it, as it is their maſters <hi>worke,</hi> not as it is their Maſters ſinne, for except theſe things be diſtinguiſhed, God himſelfe can no more avoide the calumniation of being the author, than poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of being the miniſters of ſinne; for that God concurreth with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to every action whatſoever, as touching the ſubſtance of the action, is out of all queſtion, ſeeing both all power whence actions iſſue, are derived from him, and that no power can proceede into act without his preſent aſſiſtance and operation, but yet to the <hi>crime,</hi> the <hi>faultineſſe,</hi> the <hi>inordination,</hi> the <hi>unlawfullneſſe</hi> of the action (wherein the nature of ſinne doth <hi>for malice</hi> conſiſt) hee concurreth not. But it wholly proceedeth from the infection of the concupiſcence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the faculties of the ſoule are originally defiled, the actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves iſſuing from the powers, and the ſinfulneſſe of the actions from the ſinfulneſſe of the powers, like corrupt ſtreames flowing from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier ſprings. It is not therefore every concurrence of the ſervants with the Maſter to a ſinfull action, which cauſeth the ſtaine, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin upon the ſervant: as when he conſenteth and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth only to the action, not to the ſinne: namely, likes and approves it, as his maſters worke, yet utterly diſlikes it as it is his maſters tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, likes of the worke for the obligation of obedience, wherein (touching worke) he ſtandeth to ſerve his Maſter, and yet diſlikes of the ſinne, for the great obligation wherin every one ſtandeth toward the honour of God. But yet (to anſwer ſecondly, to the point of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting) the ſervant ought not for any diſlike or deteſtation of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed ſinne, to reſiſt or reject his maſters commandement touching the worke: for in obeying hee is at moſt but the miniſter of another mans ſinne (and that as they ſay <hi>per accidens,</hi> namely, as it is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a worke) but in reſiſting hee is directly the author of his owne ſinne, by withdrawing his obedience about bodily ſervice from<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7551:44"/> I ſay, for the maſter doth not ſinne onely in commanding his ſervant to worke, but in working him, and ſo bringing his command into execution; which thing the ſervant knowing to be unlawfull, muſt (that he may not partake therein) not onely, not touch it with one of his fingers, but alſo perſwade the contrary and modeſtly rebuke it. Again, hee ought to attend on holy workes, which directly will hinder that unlawfull worke, and to theſe is he bound as Gods ſervant that day. Thirdly, by approving; and this the ſervant doth really, by his worke, and by his example.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond ſolution is found by this that hath been ſet downe, to be vaine and frivolous, the ſervant muſt refuſe to ſinne in any kinde. And his refuſall in this kinde is not againſt the Law of nations as we have heretofore ſhewed, nor againſt his owne covenant, for his covenant (though without limitations expreſſed) doth not exempt him from the ſervice of his Prince and Country, the Prince may preſſe him to the warres, much leſſe from the ſervice of his God, when his Lord and Saviour preſſeth him to his warres; as he doth in the day of aſſembling his army in holy beauty. It is therefore wicked and injurious to God, man, nations, lawes and covenants, that you ſay, that the Servant ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth bound to his maſter in all bodily ſervice, without any exception of the Sabbath more than other dayes. Your phraſe you uſe of the <hi>Servants reſisting,</hi> is your owne; we teach the ſervant may refuſe and muſt, all ſuch workes which God hath forbidden to be done that day; but not reſiſt, no, hee muſt acknowledge his maſters authority, though not obey his unlawfull commands, and be ſo farre from reſiſting, that he muſt ſuffer patiently the hard uſage of an evill maſter, and endure ſtripes rather than offend God, in all, committing his cauſe to him that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly.</p>
               <p>And for the ſervants more full direction in this thing, one caſe of Conſcience I would here briefely decide, which is this, what workes may ſervants doe on the Sabbath, and in what are they under their maſters command and bound
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7551:44"/> to obey them? <hi>Anſw.</hi> To conceive hereof plainely: There are foure ſorts of workes lawfull on the Sabbath: Firſt, workes of holineſſe. Secondly, workes of mercy. Thirdly, workes that are in their nature ſervile, yet doe directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the preſent worſhip of God; as out travell to the places of Gods worſhip: for theſe workes become now holy workes, and are not <hi>ours</hi> but <hi>Gods</hi> workes. Fourthly, workes of common honeſty, that is, workes that make to the comely, decent and orderly performance of Gods worſhip, and our carriage and behaviour therein. Such are the tolling of a bell for the calling of the Aſſembly, the comely and modeſt dreſſe of the body, provided that it be not vaine, curious, nor aske much time, but be thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the narroweſt roome that may bee. The ſpreading of our Table, ſo that ſtate be not taken up, and all things bee prepared before as much as may bee, with the like. By <hi>workes of mercy,</hi> I meane, not onely the <hi>neceſſarie</hi> labours in the helpe of the ſicke, and of women in travell, and of beaſts out of a pit, with the like; but alſo all thoſe that are called <hi>workes of neceſſity,</hi> which I rather call <hi>workes of mercy,</hi> becauſe they are therefore neceſſary, as they tend to the preſervation of things, not from feared or ſuſpected, but eminent and imminent and preſent danger; and the worke it ſelfe muſt be done in mercy, not in covetouſneſſe or other reſpects. Now of this ſort are theſe workes, labour in proviſion of convenient foode, tendance of cattell, fight for defence of our country being aſſailed, riding of poſtes on the affaires of the ſtate in cauſes of preſent and imminent danger.</p>
               <p>In all theſe the maſter hath power to command, and ſo hath the ſuperiour over him that is under his charge, and the ſervant is bound to obey. The maſter may command him the workes of mercy, and the workes ſervile, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly looke to the worſhip of God, or to goe with him to the Sermon though many miles off (if it cannot bee had neerer hand) and as the maſter may take his horſe and ride thither, his ſervant going on foote, ſo may hee command
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7551:45"/> his ſervant for this purpoſe to ſaddle his horſe, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 22, 23. The queſtion of the Shunamites husband ſheweth, who to his wife deſiring one of the Aſſes to bee made ready, and a ſervant to be ſent her, that ſhe might go to the man of God, ſaith on this wiſe, <hi>Wherefore wilt thougo to him to day? it is neither now moone nor Sabbath.</hi> It was then their cuſtome ſo to doe on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>new moone.</hi> In like manner, the maſter may injoyne the ſervant ſuch workes as tend to neceſſary proviſion of foode, and tending of children in the family, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet here againe ſome things ſeeme to fight with the ſanctification of the day: Firſt, if the maſter ſhall ſtrictly ſtand upon his ſtate and diſtance, for if the familie-neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in reſpect of young children ſhould neceſſarily require the preſence of ſome conſtantly at home, the maſter may not keepe his ſervant hereby conſtantly from the publike worſhip, but rather ſometimes change turnes with him. Much leſſe may he deſire ſuch unneceſſary ſuperfluities as may cauſe abſence from the Aſſemblies: for this is to feede thy carcaſe on the life blood of the ſoules of thy ſervants. Deale in all plaineneſſe of heart, and know thou haſt to deale with God. The ſervant muſt be ſure the worke is unlawfull before he offer to withdraw his obedience, but thou maiſt ſinne in that worke in which thy ſervant ſinneth not, becauſe thou art bound to ſearch more into the nature of thy neceſſities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the maſter ſet not his buſineſſe in ſo wiſe and diſcreet an order, that without all unneceſſary hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances hee and all his houſhold may ſanctifie the day and keepe it holy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the maſter remember not that he is a God, and that both by communication of name and power, to provide for and ſee to the ſervants and his houſholds reſt, and therein reſpect that mercy which God would have ſhewen to ſervants, yea, to cattell on that day.</p>

All they therefore that did any worke on the Sabaoth were to dye the death by the judiciall law: they, I ſay, that did it, not they that were made to doe it; which were as well paſſive as active in doing of it: namely, they that did it of election, as free, that might abſtaine from worke and would not, not they that did it of injunction and neceſſitie, as ſervants that would abſtaine from worke and might not; whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was ſuch that they would not worke by their maſters direction, might be made to worke by their maſters compulſion, for a hard caſe it were, if poore ſervants to whom no commandement to ceaſe from worke was given by God, and yet might be compelled to worke by men, ſhould dye for it, if they did ſo worke.

               <p>Conſider it well, if to kindle a fire to prepare things for the building of a Church be unlawfull, which your ſelfe hold to be a light worke, and cannot but confeſſe to be no worke of private gaine; then certainely much more are all other light workes forbidden, that fall not under the works afore-rehearſed.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, but let us ſee what you alledge in our Saviour; He approved <hi>of the letting of the Oxe to the water, of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the eares of corne: He made clay to annoint the eyes of the blinde: He bade the lame man healed,</hi> take up his bed. What then? Are therefore light workes to be done? It is no light worke to make clay and carry beds; or that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be your reaſon; nay your inſtances are all wide from your purpoſe; you neede clay or glue, to glue them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chriſt alloweth not theſe workes of letting the Oxe to water, and rubbing the eares of Corne, becauſe they are light; but becauſe they were workes of mercie to ſave life, that could not bee deferred, and did thoſe other workes himſelfe; not becauſe they were light, but inlightning. He commanded the impotent man to carry his bed; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was laborleſſe, for it was laborſome, and therefore did he preſcribe him that, and no light worke to ſhew his perfect ſoundneſſe, and the truth of the miracle, to excite him and all to glorifie God.<note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, thus we neede not diſpenſation for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but a pardon for your abuſe of his bleſſed words and deeds. That alſo which you alledge touching his being under the Law, cuts the throat of your ſolution to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and gives us juſt cauſe to conſider and conclude, that all that you, or any other Divine hath ever ſaid for the Chriſtians freedome on the Lords day, will bee found but the Iewes freedome, which both they might have had, and had alſo by the Law of the fourth Commandement, had not their ſuperſtition, or ſuperſtitious teachers, wrongd the Law, and them; for ſee what Chriſt did on the Sabbath and allowed, and in that behold thoſe burdens of Iewiſh ſuperſtition abandoned, and that (as ſome call it) of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie; which yet are no other, than matter of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian dutie to the eternall and morall Law, delivered in the fourth Commandement.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, you would that things that tend to decency might be done, without which the ordinances cannot bee ſo uſed to order and edification.

So may our Bells be thus rung.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is not againſt Chriſtian liberty to have the preciſe day appointed of God: it was not againſt the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory of our nature in integritie.

               <p>BVt let that be admitted alſo; firſt, that the commandement was immediatly given to ſervants. Secondly, that it was given touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lighteſt degree of workes. Let ſervants bee the perſons, and thoſe workes the matter to whom, and of which the commandement was given, is your doctrine yet juſtified hereby, &amp; ſubject to no other reproofe? The perſons have afforded me exceptions againſt it, becauſe the commandment was not given to ſervants And the matter becauſe it was not impoſed touching that light ſort of works; the time alſo will, becauſe it cannot be underſtood of the Lords day; for what day was it, of which the charge of vacation was ſo ſtrictly given? Was it not the ſeventh day of the weeke? The ſeventh (ſaith the precept) is the Sabaoth of the Lord thy God; <hi>In it thou ſhalt doe no worke.</hi> And why the ſeventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe in ſixe dayes the Lord finiſhed all the workes of creation, and reſted the ſeventh day; therefore he ſanctified the ſeventh day; and what day is it whereof we queſtion?

                  <p>You proceed, and would prove this wicked aſſertion, <hi>That it is no breach of any Divine commandement, for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at the commandement of his maſter, nay, for any one on his owne head, to worke on our Sabbath, which is the Lords day, the firſt day of the weeke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the commandement, ſay you, cannot be underſtood <hi>of the Lords day.</hi> Why I pray you, can you underſtand it of any other day ſave the Sabbath day? Doth not the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the precept ſound thus, Remember the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it? You yeeld in the next breath, that <hi>the Lords day</hi> is the Chriſtians Sabbath. You muſt then yeeld, that the commandement is underſtood of it. You would bee thus underſtood, and take it very hainouſly, that you ſhould be ſaid to oppoſe Gods Sabbath, do you? No: you doe not, nor ever did. Farre bee it from you; to thinke it, were to wrong you; to write it, were to calumniate you (thus you pleade for your ſelfe in the firſt ſection of your Reply, pag. 61, 62.) Yet lo, now the commandement cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Lords day? Why then, ſay man, <hi>the Lords day</hi> is not the Sabbath; for of the Sabbath is the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but to your reaſoning; for it is not reaſon nor religion.</p>
                  <p>What day was it of which the charge was ſo ſtrictly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? was it not of the ſeventh day of the weeke, ſay you? Yes indeed, of the ſeventh, as the precept was firſt applied to man. But aske againe, Why of the ſeventh more than the ſixth? And the Lord anſwereth, Becauſe it was <hi>the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord:</hi> for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ceaſeth to be <hi>the Lords Sabbath,</hi> the commandement is not of it, (as you alſo acknowledge, or elſe why keepe you it not?) Yet the commandement ſtandeth in full vigor, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>ſanctifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſting on the Sabbath. To the Iewes</hi> the ſeventh from the Creation was the Sabbath, the commandement ſtood in vigor to them for that day: <hi>to the Chriſtian,</hi> the ſeventh, even the <hi>firſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7551:51"/> day of the weeke</hi> is the Sabbath: the commandement ſtands in vigor to them alſo for that day. Therefore he ſaith not, Remember thou ſanctifie the ſeventh day, and keep it Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; nor, thou ſhalt doe no worke on the Sabbath day, for it is the ſeventh: but he ſaith, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it;</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the ſeventh, for it is the Sabbath.</hi> This Reaſon you leape, and yet you aske a Why; <hi>And why the ſeventh? Becauſe God reſted thereon, and ſanctified the ſeventh day.</hi> Here you violate firſt, the words of the commandement written with Gods owne finger, and then the ſenſe; for it is thus read, <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 20. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore hee ſanctified the Sabbath day,</hi> or reſting day, and ſo hee ſanctified our Sabbath day as well as theirs: for, the Sabbath he ſanctified, be it what day hee ſhall be pleaſed to nominate: a matter of infinite comfort to us, that deſire to doe the duties of the day with faith, in Gods both bleſſing, and acceptation. And hereby your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is utterly weakened.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this reaſon is given both as a reaſon of the reſt on that day, and as a plaine declaration of the inſtitution of that Sabbath day, and of this day in the precept now. Hee reſted the ſeventh day, <hi>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day and hallowed it.</hi> When did hee ſo? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. In the beginning. Yea, he did ſanctifie the ſeventh. Yea, then <hi>he ſanctified the Sabbath,</hi> it was inſtituted, when <hi>he bleſſed and ſanctified it,</hi> and this was in the Creation. But how was this done? The very worke of the day inſtituted the day, which was this, <hi>the Lords reſting, bleſſing, and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</hi> Now this teacheth us, that the inſtitution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in reſpect of the determination of the time, is to bee looked for, in the worke of God. <hi>Gods reſting, bleſſing, and ſanctifying the ſeventh day,</hi> made it <hi>the Sabbath day:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the commandement it is ſaid, <hi>The ſeventh is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and the following words ſhew how it was made the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and what day he <hi>bleſſeth, and ſanctifieth, is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt is the Lord of the Sabbath, by whom the worlds were made, Col.</hi> 1. 16. by whom alſo they are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7551:52"/> looke in his worke, and find undoubtedly the making and inſtitution of the day to the world renewed; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day he lay in the grave, here was no worke of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſanctifying; but <hi>the firſt day of the weeke very early he aroſe, and appeared to his Diſciples; and unfolded the Scriptures, and opened their underſtandings to underſtand them.</hi>

Whence it is cleare, that the Goſpell preached by the Apoſtles with the holy Ghoſt ſent downe from heaven, is the Word of the Lord that endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was enjoyned by the <hi>Apoſtles precept,</hi> and obſerved by them: enjoyned, and the worke of the day in part preſcribed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. obſerved <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>that which you have ſeene and heard in me, that doe; and the God of peace ſhall be with you, Phil.</hi> 4. 9. But this was ſeene, and heard of, to bee done by him, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. Therefore do it. <hi>Perkins</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. verſ. 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the ſame reaſon, grounded on Gods Word, be as well for the firſt day of the weeke, as it was once for the Sabbath of the Iewes, then we are as certainely tyed by the Lord to the obſervation of this day, as they were for their Sabbath: for the ſame reaſon is of the ſame force. But there is the ſame reaſon; therefore wee are bound by the Lord. That there is the ſame reaſon, is apparant by thoſe three places laid together, <hi>Exod. 20. 10. Mat. 12. 8. Ioh.</hi> 5. 23. The maine reaſon of the Iewes Sabbath is, becauſe it was the <hi>Sabbath of the Lord.</hi> In like manner ours <hi>is the Sabbath of the Lord Chriſt,</hi> when hee had finiſhed the worke of our redemption: for which cauſe hee taketh this name, <hi>the ſon of man is even Lord of the Sabbath:</hi> as if in more words he ſhould ſay; when God the Father had once ended the making of the world, hee reſted, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed himſelfe to be the Lord of that reſt, and dedicated it to himſelfe, giving it the name of the Sabbath of the Lord. In like manner, when I ſhall have finiſhed the worke of mans Redemption, I will reſt (&amp; have the day of my reſt dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto my ſelfe; for which cauſe, I ſay, that the ſonne of man is even Lord of the Sabbath alſo; it ſhall be called, <hi>the Lords day.</hi> And thus the will of the Father ſhall be fulfilled, which is, that as they honoured the <hi>Father</hi> in keeping the Sabbath betwixt the Creation and Redemption; ſo they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7551:53"/> ſhould honour <hi>the Sonne,</hi> in keeping the Sabbath betwixt the redemption and conſummation of the world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the judgments of God fearefully, and to miracles lighting on the contemners and prophaners of this day by worldlineſſe, the oppoſition of godleſſe and moſt evill men; the Conſcience working on men, for the obſervation and againſt the neglect thereof; the errors of Familiſts, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, Papiſts, and ſuch looſe pleaders, as you and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſhewed themſelves to be, are ſtrong and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable arguments for the Divine Authority of it; together with the contradictions, and the groſſe opinions you are forced to runne into, which argue that you rebell againſt the light in you, and your prophane Atheiſticall hearts would have that true, which yet your owne light diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, in the truths that are forced thereby to drop from you.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, yea I ſhall (through Gods grace) evince this, that it is of the <hi>Lords owne inſtitution:</hi> for, beſides that his <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection inſtitutes it,</hi> as I ſayd before;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is called <hi>the Lords day. Rev.</hi> 1. 10. Which cannot bee for any reaſon, but becauſe it is of the <hi>Lords inſtitution:</hi> for ſo, firſt, the phraſe, <hi>his day,</hi> not by creation, for ſo all daies are his; not by deſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that intendeth a time yet to come; and ſo the day of generall judgement is his 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 2. but by conſecration, and choiſe and inſtitution; <hi>a fourth way</hi> I would heare deſigned, and then I ſhall bee ready to make anſwer. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the like phraſes of Scripture prove it in the ſame caſe in <hi>Exod. 20. 10. the ſeventh is the Sabbath of the Lord;</hi> in other ordinances of Chriſt, <hi>the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 10. the Table of the Lord, 1. Cor. 10. 21. his miniſtry, 1. Tim.</hi> 1. 12. Thirdly, the manner of predication ſheweth, <note n="x" place="margin">Thom. Aquin. 3. q. 16. art. 3.</note> that this day belongeth to him by his owne aſſuming, properly, for its predicated of him denominatively, becauſe it is ſaid to bee of the Lord denominatively, the man Chriſt is not the Lords, but the Lord; but his will, hand, Paſſion is lightly called, the Lords Will, the Lords hand, the Lords paſſion: for <hi>that which is</hi> of, and belonging properly to the Lord, is called the Lords. <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               <p>Secondly, but you go about to prove the Iewes Sabbath ceremoniall, becauſe firſt, it was a ſigne of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Iewes and Gentiles, and part of the partition wall. The firſt part of this proofe was anſwered before; it was a ſigne betweene God and them, that the Lord ſanctified them; ſo the Sanctification of the Sabbath (underſtand it of ours) is ſtill a ſigne that God ſanctifieth a man, every ſigne is not a ceremonie, as every living creature is not a man. The Sabbath was a ſigne of the creation, ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaenaſiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="r" place="margin">Athanaſ. &amp; de Sabbato &amp; Circumciſ.</note>, yet not therefore a ceremonie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of your proofe implyed, when you ſay it was a part of the partition wall, is very unſound: the partition wall <note n="ſ" place="margin">Zanch. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 2. v. 14. 15.</note> ſpoken of in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 14. was the Law of Commandements contained in ordinances ſpoken of in the next verſe, which was not the Law morall, but the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; therefore you muſt prove firſt the Sabbath to bee ceremoniall, and then wee yeeld it is taken away, and ſo farre forth as you can make that good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, againe to prove it ceremoniall, you alledge the place in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. but that the <hi>Apost.</hi> ſpeaketh not there of the fourth Commandement is evident. Firſt, becauſe hee treateth expreſly of thoſe Sabbaths which were of the ſame ranke with the New-Moones, and were ceremoniall ſhadowes of things to come in Chriſt: but the Sabbath preſcribed in the Decalogue, is altogether of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as hath beene, and ſhall be further ſhewed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſpeaketh as the Apoſtles doth to the <hi>Galatians, cap.</hi> 4. 10. but the place there treates only of the obſervation of the dayes, moneths, and yeeres, which pertained to the ſervitude and bondage <hi>of weake and beggerly rudiments;</hi> as in verſ. 9. appeareth. Now that any precept of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue ſhould bee ſo accounted and reckoned as a weake and beggerly rudiment, was farre from the <hi>Apostle</hi> to thinke, and is abhorred to Chriſtian eares and religion.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever alſo was Ceremoniall in the Sabbath (if it bee granted according to the opinion of many Divines, that ſome ceremony was in the day) in reſpect of that preciſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7551:55"/> day, that is, by conſtitution annexed to it <hi>extrinſecally,</hi> and not of the nature of the Sabbath, and firſt inſtitution therof, which nothing hinders the morality of the ſeventh dayes inſtitution; for ſo in the Authority of Fathers and firſt borne, which pertaines to the fifth commandement, there was annexed a Ceremoniall reaſon of a type, namely, the ſhadowing out of Chriſt, <hi>the firſt borne among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> yet by this annexed typical figure, the fifth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, nor the priviledge of the <hi>firſt borne,</hi> in reſpect of the firſt nature of it, is not ceremoniall.</p>
               <p>Nevertheles, by Scripture there appeareth not unto me of certainty, any ceremony or type in the obſervation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day properly ſo called: for the mention of a ſpirituall Sabbatiſme in <hi>Heb</hi> 4. 9. preſignified in ſome type foregoing, under the <hi>nature of a type</hi> if referred only to the reſt in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and by <hi>compariſon of the like,</hi> to the reſt of God: but by no meanes in the leaſt ſignification is it referred to the reſt commanded in the fourth precept, as to a <hi>type and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Fathers, and many others include the <hi>Iewiſh Sabbath</hi> within the former text, they muſt in my judgement, bee underſtood of that day, as it was the day in which the ceremoniall worſhip (which was then the worſhip of God) was the ſanctification of the Sabbath, and as that preciſe day was, till Chriſt came, apt and fit; but now after Chriſts reſurrection, not fit for the new world, but ſwallowed up of the greater, namely, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> fit for the memoriall of the workes of Creation and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For to obſerve the <hi>Sabbath</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi> Rites, were to deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the fleſh, <hi>whoſe Kingdome is not meat and drinke, but righteouſneſſe, peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> and to this the old <hi>Sabbatarian Heretikes</hi> had an aime: and to obſerve the Iewiſh ſeventh for Sabbath now, deſerves worthily the Anathema of ancient Councels, and Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſharpe ſentence, who ſaith thus; <note n="t" place="margin">Quiſque illum diem obſervat, ut litera ſonat, carnaliter ſapit, Deſpir &amp; lit. c. 14.</note> Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall keepe that day as the letter ſoundeth, ſavoureth of the fleſh.

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, but, to returne; grant it to bee ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, yet your arguing will not hold, that the Sabbath in the Commandement is utterly vaniſhed: for all that place, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in <hi>that reſt,</hi> do hold that the reſt in heaven was that which was chiefely aymed at. Now this maketh againſt you; for then a Sabbaths reſt muſt remaine till that eternall reſt bee come: for though it bee aſſured, yet it is not come. And if the aſſurance by word and pledge would have cut off the neceſſity of a <hi>Sabbath reſt</hi> to ſhadow it, then might all the ſhadowes of the ceremoniall Law have been ſpared, for they had the Word, Oath, and Spirit of God to aſſume Chriſts comming and from that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.

For I conſider that the generality, was of the morall law, of the law of nature, namely that men ſhould ſequeſter ſometime from worldly affaires, which they might dedicate to the honour of God, onely the <hi>ſpeciality,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:7551:56"/> that is the limitation and deſignement of that time, was the churches ordinance appointing firſt one certaine day, and that in relation of Chriſtian aſſemblies, namely that they might meete and pray, and and praiſe God together with one voyce in the congregation. And ſecondly deſigning that one day to the firſt day of the weeke, for ſome ſpeciall reaſons and remembrances. For firſt it was the day of <hi>Chriſts</hi> reſurrection from the dead. Secondly it was the day of the holy Ghoſts deſcention from Heauen to powre infinite graces vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The firſt of them for our iuſtification as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. The ſecond for the ſanctification, and edification of the whole Church (to omit ſome other reaſons of leſſe importance) iuſtly therefore was the conſecration of the Sabaoth tranſlated to that day.</p>

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, Yea; a ſhadow? Of which we have the ſubſtance in Chriſt? Out of Date? and expired of it ſelfe? Part of the partition wall? And yet the celebration and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath tranſlated juſtly? Then the Church, by your Doctrine, may revive the ceremoniall law, and put life into the dead carcaſe thereof; the Church may not alone embrace the <hi>ſhadow, of which Chriſt is the body,</hi> but alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it to bee embraced: the Church may tranſlate part of the ceremonial Law (which yet <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>typicall mediator</hi> would not, might not order a tittle of it, to a loope, lace, or placing of either, but keepe to the patterne ſhewed him in the Mount) and ſo by the ſame reaſon tranſlate prieſthood and all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. The Church then is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> and can <hi>conſecrate,</hi> and not only <hi>celebrate</hi> the Sabbath, all full of blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, and blemiſh to his chaſt ſpouſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and for your diſtinction of <hi>generality</hi> and <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality</hi> of the commandement, (beſides what hath been ſaid before) if you yeeld not the ſpeciality to bee morall, you turne out one commandement of the ten from being morall for all your generality for to ſay that this is the morality of the commandment &amp; no more, that ſome time ſhuld be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred to divine worſhip, maketh this commandment no more morall, then the building of the Tabernacle or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is morall: for therein this perpetuall will of God was ſhewed, that ſome place muſt bee aſſigned for Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7551:57"/> and publike worſhip.</p>
                  <p>By this alſo it will follow, that the Papiſts that in their Catechiſmes render the fourth commandement thus, <hi>keepe holy the feſtivall dayes,</hi> doe render the full ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nſe of it. Which being yeelded, this alſo will follow, that you may aſwell put it downe thus, <hi>frequent the aſſemblies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, all the feaſt daies of the Iewes conteined this generall equity. Laſtly, then God ſhould in this command nothing to particular men, becauſe it is not in their power to inſtitute theſe daies, and ſo nothing ſhalbe commanded to them further, than what publike perſons ſhall injoyne, be it but one day in the yeere: and for them neither is there any thing commanded in ſpeciall, and they ſinne not if they appoint but one day in a Moone, or if they appoint but one in a quarter, then alſo the Feaſts of Chriſts Nativity, of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Whitſontide, &amp;c. are of equall authority with the Lords day, which thing, what eares can heare with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Theſe alſo are conſtitutions of the ancient primitive Church.</p>

               <p>BVt what of that? What if the conſecration of the Sabaoth was by the Church tranſlated to the firſt day of the weeke? Was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commandement of God tranſlated alſo? That that day ought to be obſerved under the ſame obligation with the Sabaoth? For if the commandement of God were not tranſlated by the Church, together with the celebration from the ſeventh day to the firſt day, then is working on the firſt no violation of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Was the commandement of God then tranſlated from the Sabaoth to the Lords day by the decree of the Church? No: the Church did it not, let mee ſee the act. The Church could not doe it, let me ſee the authority: the Church could not tranſlate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the firſt day, which God himſelfe had namely limited to the ſeventh. For could the Church make that Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was not his commandement? Gods commandment, was to reſt on the ſeventh day, and worke on the firſt; therefore to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7551:57"/> reſt on the firſt, and worke on the ſeventh, was not his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For doth the ſame commandement of God enioyne both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and reſt on the ſame day? is there faſt and loſe in the ſame commandement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſly command or licenſe to worke on that day. Say that the Church of God may tranſlate the commandement of God from one day to another at their pleaſure, did they it therefore? I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of their authority whether they might doe it. I enquire now of the act, whether they did it; did the Church (I ſay) ever conſtitute, that the ſame obligation of Gods commandement which lay on the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for keeping of the Sabaoth day ſhould be tranſlated and laid upon the Chriſtians for keeping of the Lords day? Did the Church this, no, no, they did it not; all the wit and learning in the World will not prove it.</p>

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, this reaſoning is on falſe grounds ſuppoſed (as hath beene proved) and therefore fals to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, yet take their owne grounds.</p>
                  <p>If the Church have powre to tranſlate the day and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> they may have power, and had ſo, to tranſlate the Commandement: for the Commandement is but the conſecration of the Sabbath, and determination thereof to a certaine day.</p>
                  <p>And if they doe not tranſlate the Commandement, yet the Commandement ſtands in force for that day to which by juſt power they have tranſlated the Sabbath. For the Commandement is in force as a law of nature; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, for the celebration of <hi>a</hi> Sabbath, or elſe you deny a moralitie in any part of that Commandement, but if <hi>that</hi> your moralitie ſtand, (as without doubt it doth) then is working on that day equally a violation of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God; as working on the ſeventh, from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, for then it was ſinfull, becauſe <hi>that</hi> day was then Sabbath: and now it is ſo becauſe <hi>this</hi> is now Sabbath.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:7551:58"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, and for thoſe quaeres, let me ſee the Act? Let me ſee the Authoritie, as they may bee retorted to your conceite of their tranſlating the ſeventh day, and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it a Sabbath, ſo in the true ſenſe of conſecrating that day, you have ſeen before the Act and Authority, and may now ſee (if you winke not) that the Commandement is not tranſlated but remaines the ſame it was, namely, to keepe holy the Sabbath day. Neither is there a making of that Gods Commandement which was not his, nor yet doth the commandment containe any impoſſibilities and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. <hi>Distingue tempora, &amp; tolle dubia, Distinguiſh the times, and the doubts vaniſh,</hi> the Commandement enjoyneth reſt and holineſſe <hi>Sabbath-like</hi> on the <hi>Lords Sabbath,</hi> then <hi>that</hi> ſeventh day, now <hi>this</hi> ſeventh day: and of both is it true, <hi>the</hi> ſeventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. <hi>Then</hi> the ſeventh day was it, and ſo enjoyned thereon; <hi>Now</hi> the firſt day of the weeke, and ſo enjoyned thereon. Hence this reaſoning is eaſily anſwered. Firſt, God commanded to worke on the firſt and reſt on the ſeventh, therefore to reſt on the firſt, and work on the ſeventh was not his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, it was not then, it is now, moreover, <hi>ſixe dayes thou ſhalt worke,</hi> doth not point out, which ſixe daies, and the ſeventh day will containe both ours and theirs: and their ſeventh they knew then by the worke of Creation as our ſeventh we know by the worke of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>For the authoritie and Act of the Church we need it not, the Scripture as before, hath ſaved the labour. But that the act of <hi>this</hi> power was put forth, the Church hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and your ſelfe doe while you yeeld, the firſt day conſecrated Sabbath.</p>

                  </label> I anſwere, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that commandement to keepe a Sabaoth wherein God might be honoured, was morall; But the ſpeciality of it, namely to keepe, (1) one day of ſeven, (2) the ſeventh, (3) one whole day, (4) with preciſe vacancy from all worke, were meerely ceremoniall? the ſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie then of the commandements are vaniſhed: But for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, it is a law of nature, and remaineth. But, as the ſpeciality of that commandement implyeth plaine contradiction, with the ſabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall of the Lords day, ſo the generality of it can enforce nothing for it, for theſe are miſerable conſequents (indeed plaine fallacies of the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) that God hath ſometime commanded vacancy for his honour, therefore he hath commanded the firſt day of the weeke to be that time, or this, God hath commanded us ſome time to reſt, therefore that time we muſt preciſely abſtaine from all manner of workes: can the Church make theſe good conſequences? If it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, the celebration of the Lords day, can with no enforcement of reaſon be deduced out of the morality of Gods commandement. But if you will reply: that the Church hath eſtabliſhed the firſt day of the weeke to be the Chriſtians Sabaoth, not by way of conſequence, as deducing it out of commandement, but meerely by authority, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating and fixing Gods morall commandement to it; you may ſay your pleaſure, but I ſhall neither beleeve, nor you prove that ſuch authority belongs to the Church: or that ſuch an act hath beene eſtabliſhed by the Church: which I am ſure you can never doe neither of both; for ſeeing that all Divines acknowledge, that the ſingling out of ſuch a day to be ſanctified, namely, the ſeventh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other, was meerely ceremoniall, although it was Gods owne deſignation. I hope that you will confeſſe the ſpeciall deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt day of the weeke to that honour, before other daies, being made only by the Church, to be alſo but ceremoniall. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that no ceremonies which come not under the obligation of Gods morall law, ſhould oblige to the obſervation of ceremonies. Therefore it will never conſiſt with reaſon, that the morall law of God can by any authoritie of the Church oblige Chriſtians to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lords day.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:7551:59"/>
               <p>It is not therefore the tranſlation of the old commandement of God from the one day to the other (which yet if it were tranſlated, can oblige ſervants no otherwiſe than it did under the old law) but the inſtitution of a new commandement, of the Church her ſelfe (yet guided by the ſpirit of God) that conſecrated that day to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſervice of God.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, this objection we owne, and for your diſtinction thus diſprove it. Your granted Generality is commanded in the commandements fore-going, in which God that commands a worſhip, commands alſo time for it, as when he created the world, time was concreated of neceſſity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this vaine conceit was before blowne up. Therefore if all you name and put into the ſpeciality of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement be meerely ceremoniall, we have no fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement diſtinct from the former.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for your ſpeciality which you ſay is all meerly ceremoniall, we proved before that the light of nature would prove the contrary, and now we aſſault every particular with the ſword of the ſpirit, that the hairy ſcalpe of it may be wounded, and in the welding of the ſame put our hands on the hands of the Lords Worthies, to fetch the blowes with more force.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that one day of ſeven, and particularly the ſeventh, is not ceremoniall, is evident by the commandement, which delivered with <hi>Gods owne mouth in the mount,</hi> and charged by way of command, is no other than morall and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.

Atterſoll</hi> on <hi>Numbers</hi> 15. 35. p. 645. well obſerveth, that if one day in ſeven be not morall and perpetuall, a man may ſay that one day in ſeven weekes or ſeven yeeres is enough, and ſo at length it ſhall be ſaid, wee are not bound to meet together publikely above one day in a 100. yeers.

But this is juſt nothing, for are not one day in a yeere yeerely certaine dayes, and ſo of the reſt: and if that ſome ſhall ſay they are enough, though others ſpeake againſt it, who ſhal tel which of theſe two ſides, ſides with the truth, when what is enough (you hold) God hath not particularly determined: yea, but <hi>Gomarus</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that what dayes are ſufficient may be gathered out of the precept of the Sabbath, namely, that they be, either not more ſeldome, or elſe a little more oft, than the Sabbaths of the Iſraelites, as the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of God in giving that precept, ſheweth. For when the Lord for his clemency ſake, tooke one of ſeven onely to his worſhip for the Iſraelites, men of a ſtiffe-necke and preſſed with the heavy yoke of feaſts and other ceremonies; how ſhall more ſeldome ſuffice among Chriſtians, that are free from that yoke and burden? Very good: Can any looke on this without griefe and laughter. If out of the precept you muſt gather your ſufficient dayes, why will you not take the dayes God hath in precept warranted for ſufficient and ſufficiently bleſſed; one of ſeven, the ſeventh? If this your ſufficiency muſt be gathered from the precept, and that too as you gather that they bee more to us than were to Iewes, then we are to have two Sabbaths a weeke at the leaſt, and the Church erred that <hi>Anathematized</hi> the keepers of Saturday in the time of the Goſpell, and ſtill erreth that never ſaw this yet, much leſſe obſerved it. Or if you ſay, no they muſt not be Sabbaths, how then gather you this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the dayes out of the fourth Commandement which concerneth the Sabbath and not halfe holidaies, and other feaſts: and if the Iewes were yoked with obſervation of feaſts, &amp; therfore Gods clemency would they ſhould keep but the ſeventh day? What an inſupportable yoke doe you lay upon Chriſtians, that muſt, as you ſay, keepe more than one of ſeven, or elſe they keepe not a ſufficient number? all the Iewiſh feaſts would hardly ariſe to the number that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7551:60"/> two in a weeke conſtantly doe amount to: and what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearing is here? One of the ſeven daies of the weeke in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall revolution is not neceſſarily to be obſerved by force of the fourth Commandement. And yet fewer than one a weeke cannot be ſufficient, and that by vertue of the fourth Commandement.

                  <p>This alſo ſuffereth juſt exception, both in it ſelfe, and in reference to the matter in hand: it bindeth you yeeld; becauſe Gods command bindeth to obey the Churches juſt conſtitutions.

               <p>BVt if you aske me how farre doth that conſtitution of the Church oblige the conſcience? I anſwere you, as farre as it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, (you will deſire no more) further it cannot: It cannot oblige farther, than it doth ordaine; it cannot bind the conſcience for guiltineſſe further than it doth for obedience; becauſe all guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both preſuppoſe diſobedience; now that the Church ordained ſolemne aſſemblies of Chriſtians, to bee celebrated that day to the honour of God, and in them the invocation of Gods holy name,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7551:61"/> thankeſ-giving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearing of the holy Scriptures, and receiving of the Sacraments, is not denied; It is out of queſtion, all antiquity affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth plentifull remembrance of it. But that it injoyneth that ſevere and exact vacation, from all workes on the Lords day, which the commandement of God required in the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabaoth, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove. It reliſheth too much of the <hi>Iewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſtian divinity: for this is no proofe of it, that the Lords day is ſucceeded in place of the Sabaoth, or as ſome Divines tearme it, as the heyre of the Sabaoth. It is, I ſay, no proofe at all (except it were eſtabliſhed by the ſame authority, and the obſervance of it, charged with the ſame ſtrictneſſe of commandement) for if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Sabaoth in place, muſt it therefore ſucceed in equall preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of obſervation? (So if the Pope ſucceedeth <hi>Peter</hi> in place, muſt he therefore ſucceede him in equality of power?) The Lords day therefore ſucceedeth the Sabaoth in the point of ſanctification, for celebration of the aſſemblies, for the Church hath preciſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that, but not in the point of exact and extreme vacation, from every kind of worke, for that the Church hath not commanded: and ſo although the Lords day may well be tearmed the heire of the Sabaoth, yet is it not, <hi>ex aſſe haeres,</hi> as the civill Lawyers ſpeake. It inheriteth not the whole right of the Sabaoth, for that right and prerogative of the Sabaoth was not given to the Sabaoth and its heires; it was no fee ſimple (and if I may ſpeake in the Lawyers ſtile) it was onely a tenure for tearme of life: namely, during the life of the ceremoniall law, which life ended in the death of our Saviour. This reaſon therefore of the ſucceſſion of the Lords day in place of the Sabaoth is no reaſon.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, what was acknowledged by the Church, as injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the point of vacancie from all labour, without the leaſt relliſh of Iewiſh ceremonies; wee ſhall ſee in the next Chapter. Here onely wee examine your ſuppoſed confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a reaſon to prove it; which reaſon is this; The Lords day is ſucceeded in the place of the Sabbath, or as ſome ſay, as Heire of the Sabbath, therefore to bee kept Sabbath-like. You confute it thus: If it ſucceeds it in place, muſt it ſucceede in equall preciſeneſſe of obſervation? No, It ſucceeded in point of Sanctification, not of exact vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I reply, your diſtinction is not diſtinct; for if in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, then in exact vacation, namely, vacation Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7551:62"/> for if in the end, in the meanes neceſſary to that end, and for that end ordained, which is exact vacation, ſo farre as it may further Sanctification: Now for your playing on the termes about an Heire, it is frivolous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for your inſtance in the Pope ſucceeding <hi>Peter,</hi> arguing from place to power, it little conduceth to this matter: for the Pope ſucceedeth not in <hi>place Apoſtolicall,</hi> if he did, I ſhould not much doubt of his <hi>power Apostolicall.</hi> Had there beene a certaine Commandement of God to ſhew, that God in his eternall Law commanded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to obey <hi>the Apostolicall place?</hi> But by <hi>place</hi> you mean <hi>roome,</hi> not Officiall function, and then what kinne betweene your inſtance, and the matter in hand?</p>

Are we not bound to keepe it ſingular and inviolable, well contenting our ſelves with ſo liberall a grant of the rest, and not incroaching upon that one which God hath choſen to his honour? Were it not wretchleſſe neglect of Religion to make that very day common, and to thinke we may doe with it as with the reſt.</hi>

What by <hi>freely?</hi> May he doe it, ſo he doe it with reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? What by every man? Are ſome priviledged? As the Tempter ſaid to <hi>Eve; Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eate of every Tree of the Garden.</hi> Some need no priviledge, for ſome will not labour any day, theſe need no ſuch liberty to worke extraordinarily the Lords day, your liberty were their bondage on any day; or may ſome freely prophane it, though not every man? Or ordinary labour in none will prophane it? Or will ordinarily labour in ſome prophane it, but only extraordinary labour in other? How too ſhall one know this ordinary and extraordinary labour apart? What meane you to ſay, (<hi>Would I ſet at liberty?</hi>) becauſe, in your opinion, there is no command of God to bind; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can <hi>you</hi> bind and looſe?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is meet, ſay you, that all worldly affaires be abandoned that day, and that it be dedicated wholly to the honor of God: What? meet to doe that which no Law of God, of Apoſtles, of univerſall Synods did ever require, as you ſpake but now? What? is it meet for a preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? To diſtill your poyſon cloſely, which ſhall runne like oyle into the bones of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and none ſtay it: while the devout heart ſhall be put off with this flappe, <hi>It is meet indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is meete that Chriſtians ſhould bee as devout in reſt and ſanctity on the Lords day, as the Iewes on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. That is all one as to ſay, (according to what you have taught before,) that a man ſhould be as devout in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his owne heart, as in Gods command (for ſo you make it) and in the precepts of men, as in Gods: what <hi>deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is here of men, and <hi>vilifying</hi> of God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but what an argument is here? <hi>The obligation of our thankefulneſſe is more than theirs, though the obligation of his commandement be leſſe herein;</hi> therefore the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould be more devout than the Iew. I had thought the commandement had bound to Devotion, and the greater the more. I had thought the Greatneſſe of benefits (whence
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7551:66"/> the debt of thankfulneſſe is greatned) had increaſed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the commandement, and our obedience to it? But now you yeeld, his commandement ſome what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on our Sabbath, though leſſe, when before you utterly denyed any breach of any divine commandement in labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that day, and ſo any obligation.</p>
                  <p>To ſtrengthen this argument, you expreſſe your wiſh, <hi>that moſt religiouſly with all abſtinence, and all attendance it were kept.</hi> Doe you wiſh this with all your heart, and yet bend all your might to overthrow the commandement of God? Would you, or could you thinke, that your wiſh ſhould prevaile more than <hi>Apoſtolike</hi> truth?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, have wee in one breath theſe contradictory ſentences: <hi>No conſtitution of the Church obliging to the ſtrict deſiſting from labour.</hi> And <hi>the conſtitutions of ſome ancient Councels reſtraining that prophanation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, you come in with the <hi>Edicts</hi> of Princes, as one that would have the obſervation of the Lords day depend upon <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the Church, and <hi>Edicts</hi> of Princes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and ſo not to differ from another holy day.

Or doe you mention <hi>Princes</hi> Edicts and <hi>Churches</hi> conſtitutions to gloſe with ours? Ours deteſt your Tenet, and you ſeeke herein to wound <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Prince:</hi> for how they hold of the <hi>Lords</hi> day, that it is directly grounded on the fourth commandement, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> in the booke of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and in the <hi>Statutes</hi> and godly Proviſions for redreſſe of prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <p>Firſt, I might put off all this ſtill, becauſe it is upon this falſe ground that the Commandement of God doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne our Sabbath with the like.

(which was the point of the Apoſtles doctrine I eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred you of) That God I ſay, which commanded, and that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which inſtructed ſervants to diſobey their Maſters, and by depriving them of their ſervice cauſed their hindrance? The Apoſtle knew full well this was not the way to propagate the Goſpell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the kingdome, of Chriſt, he knew it was Chriſtian meekenes and obedience, and humility, and patience that muſt doe it: and therefore hee commandeth Chriſtian ſervants to give their maſters all honour, to obey them in all things, and to pleaſe them in al things, that ſo their maſters ſeeing them more ſerviceable and profitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and withall more vertuous than others were, might ſooner be drawne to like of the religion that made them ſuch, whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary would have bin manifeſtly a ſcandall, and grievous impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the propagation of the Goſpell, and defamed it, for a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of contumacy and diſobedience, and for a ſeminary (as it were) of diſturbance and ſedition of families and common-wealths.

For would that have beene permitted if it had beene unlawfull? Or could the Church of God bee increaſed by the ſinnes of men? His Church increaſed by that whereby himſelfe was diſhonoured? Or would the Apoſtles have permitted men to ſinne (as now Ieſuites do) for the good of the Church, (nay exhorted and commanded to it) who had himſelfe expreſly taught, that wee muſt not doe evill that good may come of it? No, neither of both can bee, becauſe either of both were a ſtaine and derogation to the righteouſneſſe of God: the intention therefore of the Apoſtles was ſimple, without all trickes of policie to teach ſervants all exact and entire obedience to their maſters, touching all workes that belong to the dutie of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, namely that were in themſelves honeſt and lawfull, without excepting of any day.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, here you would prove your Tenet, for ſervants obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their maſters commands for worke on the Lords day, even worke prohibited, to bee more agreeable to the Apoſtles Doctrine, than the contrary: and to this end you alledge Texts to prove their obedience in al things to all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, at all times, and thence conclude the anſwerableneſſe of yours, the unanſwerableneſſe of ours thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, object that you bring no proofe of Scripture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this your univerſall obedience at all times, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Sabbath day: though you ſhould have done it, eſpecially the doctrine of the Commandement touching ceſſation of worke lying ſo fully upon the ſervant. If you reply that there is no exception of time: I anſwer, there is exception of obedience to unlawfull commands, and ſuch are workes, otherwiſe lawfull; enjoyned to bee done on the Sabbath: and ſo we have equivalent exceptions to that of time.</p>
                  <p>Your ground therefore which you lay, and ſay it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Apostolike</hi> truth, namely (that Apoſtles permit ſervants no point of libertie, but command them obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without exception of maſter, of labour, or of time;) we thus impugne:</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles Doctrine touching ſervants obedience doth admit of three limitations by themſelves expreſſed;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it muſt be an <hi>obedience in the Lord;</hi>

                     </note> that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of the Lord, in all things in which godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may not be overthrowne, in all things provided, that we admit of nothing againſt the Lord. If the maſters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhould croſſe the covenant of the ſervant, as he is a man and Chriſtian to his God, it is ſinfull in the making; (if ſuch ſhould be made) and worſe in the keeping, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes voide <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> The ground of this limitation is this, that all authoritie and ſuperioritie is derived from God, and ſubordinate to him; therefore the command of an inferior power binds not to obedience, when it is contrary to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7551:69"/> precept of the ſuperior power, as <hi>Durand</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Durand. lib. 2. distinct. 39. quaest. 5.</note> well noteth.

This limitation excepts the ſervants labour in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile worke on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>Lords</hi> day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt bee an obedience <hi>wherein they abide with God</hi> in their ſervice, that is, in the obſervation of the Commandements of God, ſaith the <hi>ordinarie Gloſſe;</hi>

                     <hi>There are bounds ſet of God to ſervants, and how farre they ought to keepe them, this is alſo ordered by Law: and they may not paſſe over them: for when the maſter enjoyneth none of thoſe things which are diſpleaſing to God and diſallowed, hee ought to follow and obey; but beyond this by no meanes; for thus the ſervant is a free man. And if thou yeeld any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although thou were free, thou art become a ſlave. This therefore he intimates ſaying, bee yee not the ſervants of men.</hi> And not farre after he briefly expounds it thus <hi rend="sup">t</hi>, <hi>Obey not men that command abſurd things,</hi> yea, <hi>neither yeeld to their owne ſelves.</hi> Are not theſe Commandements of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for ſervile worke, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>abſurd and without place,</hi> and footing in Gods Word? are they not of things diſpleaſing to God? Theſe, theſe are the ſervants limits, beyond which if hee paſſe, hee is the ſervant of men, even of mens humours and a very ſlave; becauſe hee hath rejected the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7551:69"/> freedome of a freeman to God and Righteouſneſſe. Could you ſee none of theſe limitations to reſtraine your bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe gloſſe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Doctrine admits of this limitation; <hi>That the commandment of the master, bee of things poſſible, as well as lawfull:</hi> and therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant putteth the doubt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 5. What if ſhe will not come? And is in that caſe ſet free. Yea, it admits alſo of another limitation; <hi>That it bee of things, though in their nature lawfull, yet not exceeding ſo farre the ſtrength of nature, that the ſervant ſo doing ſhall manifestly ruine his body:</hi> as to toyle night and day; to toyle all dayes, and not have a day in the weeke to take breath? Now tell me, doth not the law of Nature bound the maſter in reſpect of time?</p>
                  <p>And as it hath theſe limitations, ſo it hath this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſervants owe to their maſters ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: obedience is limited to their lawfull command with the like; ſubjection reacheth to ſubmiſſion, to their wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unjuſt corrections and uſage, as in 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 18, 19. Bee ſubject to your maſters—for conſcience towards God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> Even where the ſervant may not obey, he muſt be ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, having thus cleared the <hi>Apostles</hi> doctrine, let us ſee what you ſay to prove your Tenet agreeable, ours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable thereto.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you take hold of the words <hi>in all things,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the ſervants yeelding to the maſters exacting of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that day, to be no ſinne; for then ſay you, he would not command them to obey in all things, but would have excepted that. I anſwer, by the ſame reaſon you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the ſervants yeelding to the maſter in any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull commands to be no ſinne, becauſe he is commanded to obey <hi>in all things</hi> without exception of that particular. But if you ſay, that is excepted in the former limitations; ſo ſay I, that this is alſo as hath beene proved. Obedience of ſubjection the ſervant oweth to his maſter in unjuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with him, and the Apoſtles perſwading ſervants of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7551:70"/> thoſe dayes to ſuch things, ſheweth that maſters did wrongfully binde and buffet for well doing. <note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 19.</note> Tel me, <hi>was it for working, or truth and fidelitie, and not for pietie and the worſhip of God?</hi> And therefore, may not I ſay with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter probabilitie than you have ſpoken, that it was for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of labour on the times of the holy aſſemblies? Will any correct their ſervants for performing the duties of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Table, or the ſecret duties of the firſt? It muſt needs be then, that that wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> doing was publike worſhip of God, for which chiefly <hi>Heathen</hi> maſters buffetted <hi>Christian</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And thus your very Texts have implyedly this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in them, that ſervants ſhould not doe ill, or leave the doing well for the frowardneſſe of the maſter, and not obey unlawfull commands, but beare wrongfull ſtripes, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are they called: &amp; for piety &amp; the duties of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſubmit to the ſtripe, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quit the ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>Now in that you ſay, it cannot be that the Gentiles that did not beleeve ſhould reſpect religion ſo, as not to exact their ſervants worke: I anſwer, they certainely did in that point of the Sabbath through a ſpeciall providence of God and the inclination of ſoule to this law of nature, which is in part written in the harts of all men: for S. <hi>Auſtine</hi>

August. De Civit. Dei lib. 6. cap. 11.</note> tels as much, who relating the ſaying of <hi>Seneca</hi> concerning the Iewes and the Sabbath hath theſe words, truely when he ſpeaketh of thoſe Iewes; he ſaith, When in the meane while, the cuſtome of that moſt wicked nation hath ſo farre prevailed, that now through all lands it is received: the conquered give lawes to the conquerors. Speaking theſe things he wondred, &amp; being ignorant what was wrought of God, he ſet downe plainly his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which he might ſignifie, what he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reaſon of their Sacraments; for he ſaith, but they know the cauſes of their rites, and the greater part of the people doth that which they know not why they doe it.</p>
                  <p>See how the Sabbath had prevailed among all Heathen;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7551:70"/> In <hi>Seneca's</hi> dayes who lived in the time of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> but what is that to the Lords day? Yea, thence eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you may gather how they could well afford one day in a weeke to worſhip: and Saint <hi>Austine</hi> in the ſame place ſaith, that though <hi>Seneca</hi> reproved the Iewes for loſing a ſeventh part of their time in keeping Sabbath, yet would not mention the Chriſtians to reproove their rites in any kinde, leſt hee ſhould either praiſe them againſt the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtome of his Countrey, or reprove them againſt his owne heart. Note, <hi>it was</hi> (ſaith this Father) <hi>a ſpeciall worke of God, that the Sabbath ſhould have that prevalencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Heathens.</hi> And for the Chriſtians rites of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he could not ſpeake of them but in prayſe, unleſſe he ſhould have gone againſt his conſcience, and therefore ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently paſſeth them over.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, you affirme that their withdrawing of their obedience would have cauſed the name and doctrine of God to bee blaſphemed. I anſwer, their modeſt and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble refuſall of the worke, would adorne the doctrine and not diſhonor it, and if they ſhould forſake the aſſemblies, they forſake their God and religion, the Heathen well knew it, who were ſo obſervant in their ſuperſtition. It may ſeeme by the Apoſtles rules given to ſervants and wives, that more of them were converted, than of maſters and husbands, and the aſſemblies of the Lords day more conſtantly frequented of all that had given up their names to Chriſt. Now as the rendering a reaſon of the hope that was in them to the Magiſtrate, performed with meekneſſe and feare, honoured God and his Doctrine; ſo the rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of an account how they worſhipped God on the day of aſſemblies, <hi>viz:</hi> the Lords day: (as may appeare by the <hi>Apologie</hi> of <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> for them) who in that <hi>Apologie,</hi> renders a reaſon of their worſhip of God, and of the day ſpent wholly in that worſhip. What the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith upon the Chriſtians readineſſe thus to give a reaſon of his hope, may rightly be applyed to the Chriſtian ſervants readineſſe to yeeld himſelfe wholly to God that day, and to render
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7551:71"/> the reaſon thereof with meekeneſſe and feare: <hi>And who is that will harme you, if you doe that which is good? 1 Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>But this ſubmiſſive withdrawing; you tearme by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious name of <hi>diſobedience</hi> very wrongfully; for he is to be obedient to his lawfull commands that day, and to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt corrections for the Lords ſake, which will breake the heart of any Maſter, and winne him, but your courſe would take away the very practice of religion in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for where is religion, if the publike worſhip be gone? Nor will this deprive them of their ſervice, but make them in higher eſteeme, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was, and the famous courtier <hi>Daniel,</hi> for refuſing to obey the king decree: when Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites ſhall bee loathed and caſt out. Yet if this ſhould not alwaies be, <hi>the Spirit of glory and of God will reſt</hi> upon him that ſuffers in theſe caſes.

                  <p>This would propagate the Goſpell; as in <hi>Daniels</hi> caſe is to be ſeene, and in the caſe of the three children.</p>
                  <p>This is abſolute meekeneſſe, obedience, humilitie and patience, and ſuch ſervants for their vertue, and the profit that commeth to their maſters, by their faithfull ſervice in the times and ſeaſons due, and their unfained reſpect, even when they receive wrong, ſhall carry in the eyes of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, high reſpects and praiſe; but if your courſe were held that the ſervant ſhould neglect the aſſemblies to doe his maſters worke on that day (we ſpeake of workes unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be done on the Sabbath) and ſhould carry an heart to God, while his feete and hands carried him to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters worke; (which is all one, as if one ſhould ſweare with his tongue and thinke to keepe his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne) then where is the ſolemne worſhip of God? And that gone, where is Religion? And that gone, what vertue? And that gone, what profitable ſervice? Maſters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7551:71"/> but their owne lucre, can conne you little thankes for this doctrine. Beſides, this were the ſcandall and defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpell for ever; that whereas <hi>all</hi> Religions teach the followers thereof a time for pietie with all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of body and ſoule for that time; this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould teach that the ſervant hath no time at all, nor doth God require it of him, but the contrary, if his maſter will but bid him worke.</p>
                  <p>This can be no ſeminarie of diſturbance or contumacie, for he is ſubject to his maſters power for correction; ſo as not to reſiſt in wrongfull ſufferings: but yours ſheweth it manifeſtly while it leaveth a man in anothers hands againſt two ſuch principles, that when they have beene by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie preſt to goe againſt them, rebellion hath ever followed. The principles are theſe: Firſt, God muſt bee ſolemnely and publikely worſhipped, and that on ſome times weekly in which hee is to bee attended upon without avocations. Secondly, that Nature ſheweth the preſervation of it ſelfe. Now to go about to blot out ſenſe of God &amp; religion, &amp; to keepe men to taskes of inſupportable burdens, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture breaketh under, while it beares them, this is the ready way to overturne all.</p>
                  <p>This alienates not maſters from their Chriſtian ſervants: let the experience of all ages ſhew it. In this nation the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that make conſcience of the Sabbath are ſought after by all ſober and wiſe maſters, that onely are wiſe for the world: for theſe are thoſe that will not be night-walkers, nor drunkards, nor filchers, with the like. I know none but chooſe ſuch, and greatly affect them, and for their fidelity otherwiſe and induſtry, give them great liberties for Gods worſhip. True, I have heard of ſome of our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that will by no meanes have ſuch a ſervant, eſpecially to waite on their perſons, or to be their Clerkes, but one may eaſily ſmell the reaſon, it is not for any matter of Sabbaths labour or reſt; but, firſt there is a divelliſh principle amongſt them, that it is for their reputation to have their men, ſuch as will make the ſervant of their neighbour-Gentleman. <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

Therefore both old and young, both woman and ſervant ſhall live, and if need bee ſhall dye, being faithfully obedient to the commandements, which dying were but to be made alive by death; we certainely know both children, and women, and ſervants to have beene no leſſe than excellent oftentimes, their parents, and huſbands, and maſters being ſet againſt it. They ought therefore which would leade an holy life, not to be of a leſſe cheerefull and ready minde, when they ſee ſome to chaſe them from it: But it is meete much more that they contend and ſtrive ſtoutly, that they fall not off, as conquered, from the beſt and moſt neceſſary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: for I doe not thinke it may admit any compare, whether it be better to be received into the fellowſhip of the Almighty, or to chooſe the darkeneſſe of divels. Things which are done of us for others ſake, we will alwayes doe, endeavoring to have an eye to them for whoſe ſake they ſeeme to bee done, taking the meaſure to be, that which is acceptable to them: but things which are done rather for our owne ſake, than for others, ſhall be done by us with equall ſtudy, whether they ſeeme, or ſeeme not to pleaſe any man.</hi>

               <p>ANd therefore Sir, to draw to an end (for I grow wearie, and have already both dulled my penne, and my ſelfe) I would adviſe you in the Name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Miniſter you are, and whoſe worke you have in hand, to examine this doctrine of yours, what foundation it may have in the Word of God, and what effect in the Church of God; leſt the foundation happily be your owne phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, not Gods Word, and the effect prove the poyſoning, not the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the Church. I know Sir, you are not the firſt that ſet this doctrine abroach, nor the onely man that drawes of the veſſell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though few (as I am told) draw ſo freely as you.

But I ſay in the beginning, I would neither cenſure nor divine of the evill conſequence of this Doctrine: let them cenſure (if they will) to whom the governement of the Church and Commonwealth, and proviſion of peace in both, doth belong. And to divine (me thinkes) there is little neede; the events are too evident, even to meane foreſight, already to require divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for who (when he ſeeth that ſeede ſowne) doubts what graine will be reaped in heavineſſe?

                  <p>This is your Concluſion, which hath in it three things; a <hi>provocation</hi> to a polemicke Diſcourſe (if he be able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Doctrine) urged, from the duty of a Miniſter, which is twofold; to defend his Doctrine, to reduce his ſtraying brother; and from your challenge. Secondly, a <hi>requeſt</hi> of two things in the Anſwer to this his Treatiſe, ingenious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the force of his arguments, and materiall arguments againſt him. Thirdly, an <hi>Adjuration</hi> (upon ſenſe of the falſhood of the Doctrine, or inability to juſtifie it) to make up the breach of his Kinſmans conſcience, and reſtore him to his Maſters obedience. The <hi>provocation</hi> is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Letter, printed at the end of your Treatiſe, which by the Publiſher is termed, <hi>An anſwer to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe:</hi> but he might have well ſeene it was <hi>an anſwer only to this provocation.</hi> Here hee ſhewed a <hi>ſpirit of calumniation,</hi> and <hi>a love of all devouring words, like a falſe tongue.</hi> And how ſtrong an anſwer that is hereunto all may judge, that, (conſidering with what a ſpirit Maſter <hi>Breerwood</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed) cannot but know with what an heart he both writ, and provoked that patient man to contend: eſpecially if all knew alſo what he wrote unto Maſter <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> Alderman
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7551:75"/> of Cheſter, his Coſen, the ninth of Iune, 1611. One paſſage of which Letter I annexe out of that Letter which I have with me, in the originall under his owne hand.

The one or the other must be done (now he hath provoked me to ſtirre) or elſe ſome blemiſh will ſticke by him. If he anſwer my arguments ſoundly, and there by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reaſons eſtabliſh his owne Doctrine, I have ſoone done, he ſhall ſatisfie and ſilence me, I will preſently yeeld, and withall both love and praiſe him: but if hee bee not able to doe it (as I ſuſpect hee is not) and will yet perſiſt in the fancy, I ſhall both deteſt and deſpiſe his pertiuacy, and perhaps diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him in the end.</hi>

                  <p>For the occaſion, three things will lively repreſent it to the world; a briefe relation concerning the condition of <hi>Iohn Breerwood</hi> at that time: ſecondly, the comparing of ſome paſſages in Maſter <hi>Breerwoods</hi> relation with the former: thirdly, the beginning of Maſter <hi>Byfields</hi> anſwer to this Treatiſe, containing a ſhort and ſatisfactory anſwer to this particular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this was the true ſtate of things concerning <hi>Iohn Breerwood</hi> at the time while theſe things fellout. <hi>Iohn Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> was ſervant and Apprentice to one Maſter <hi>Thomas Shipton Grocer</hi> in <hi>Fridayſtreet,</hi> in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Iohn the Evangeliſt:</hi> He was imployed by his Maſter on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and going downe, hee fell in love with a Maide that accompanied him downe at the ſame time. Whereupon when hee returned (as was manifeſt by the conſequents) hee caſt in his mind which way to wind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of his Maſters ſervice. For the attaining of his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered deſire, when yet hee had not ſpent halfe the time of his Apprentiſhip in his Maſters ſervice, hee made therefore many ſcruples; ſome about the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> pretending his conſcience had been much wrought upon by Maſter <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Byfield</hi> in that his foreſaid journey; ſome about his calling in the weeke dayes. About the Sabbath, when his Maſter bade him fetch a pint of wine, or ſee his horſe have provender, or call the invited Gueſt to dinner, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to doe it: which thing his Maſter (ſuppoſing it had been indeed upon ſome trouble of conſcience) with joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Miniſter of the pariſh, M. <hi>Walker,</hi> and therupon ſought meanes to bind and retaine him the faſter in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: for his Maſter was a conſcionable and religious man, and carefull of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and hoped that here would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the diſcovery of ſome good wrought in him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was many wayes untoward. But this <hi>Iohn Breerwood</hi> ſaw, that this would take no place, he caſts other ſcruples
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7551:76"/> about the workes of his Calling, to get off that way, by his pretexts of the evils he ſaw attended Trades in the City: and this turned not off his Maſter from his deſires to retaine him, but rather increaſed them the more. Afterwards, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Religion pretended wrought againſt his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded plot, and not for it, hee fell to impudent and vile ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe. On a time, his Maſter, for ſome ſtubbornneſſe of his, gave him a boxe on the eare: then he found out this project; to lay his Dagger under his pillow; that when the maides ſhould find it there, and relate it to their Maſter, he might conceive he had ſome intent to play ſome vile part; and being a timorous man, might bee moved to turne him out of his ſervice. After this, his Maſter upon his earneſt deſire, ſent him downe againe to <hi>Cheſter</hi> to gather up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; who there gathered up to the ſumme of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, or thereabout, his Maſter fearing to loſe it, gave way to his motion to leave his ſervice, and ſet up for himſelfe in <hi>Chester,</hi> that ſo he might get his money of him. This <hi>Iohn Breerwood</hi> thus releaſed, married the former wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and ſince, putting her to ſhift for her ſelfe, hath been to and fro beyond Sea, and hath played many prankes.</p>
                  <p>This Relation was taken from <hi>Maſter Walkers</hi> mouth, March 30. 1631. as a briefe of thoſe things that might bee more largely ſet downe: the Chriſtian Reader for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction, if hee deſire it, may enquire of him who was very well acquainted with all thoſe paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider with me ſome paſſages in Maſter <hi>Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> Relation:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſaith, the true cauſe of his diſtemper was a Caſe of Conſcience about workes on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> yet hee ſaw, that at the firſt diſcovery of his ſtrange alteration, were diſcovered obſtinate reſolutions, by faire or foule meanes to forſake his ſervice. Hee is little skill'd in the plight of a wounded conſcience, that can thinke ſuch a conſcience, and ſuch obſtinateneſſe are compatible to the ſame man at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee talketh of his Maſters great offence; yet
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7551:77"/> this was no other, but that as one joyed to ſee hee made ſome ſhew of conſcience in that thing, he ſought all meanes to tie him the faſter to him and his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee talketh alſo of his Kinſmans affliction: What? From ſuch a man as was ſo milde as his Maſter was?</p>
                  <p>Who can beleeve that this matter about his Kinſman was any more than an occaſion, no cauſe in truth of Maſter <hi>Breerwoods</hi> attempts? ſome thing there was beſides this, as rightly he acknowledgeth.</p>
                  <p>And to put it out of doubt, heare M. <hi>Byfield</hi> ſpeake after long ſilence under theſe injuries, beginning his Treatiſe thus,</p>

                        <p>LO (Sir) I am become at length a Writer. Your ſtrange bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, and great thoughts of heart, have wrung from me that reſolution, which once I thought had not been in the power of man to urge me to. The Lord make it proſperous, if it be his wil, or els give me more patience hereafter to forbeare imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where I can goe about it with ſo little hope of ſucceſſe. I write not while I write: Partly becauſe the diſcharge of my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling commands me to labor other waies, and partly becauſe my judgement is not every way reſolved of the expediency of an anſwer in this kind. One thing I am ſure of, that I can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſeale the <hi>Doctrine of the Sabbath,</hi> as it is now taught in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with my blood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is as apparent reaſon for it, as for any other point of Religion. Thus much I eaſily grant upon the reading of your writings, that if your places of invention had been as ſound, as your forme of elocution is faire, and the matter had been anſwerable to the ſtile, you ſhuld eaſily have had my voice for the Chaire amongst the truly learned: but when I conſider of your aſſertions concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> unmasking them, and without the varniſh caſt upon them, I cannot but ſee cauſe to lament, that ſuch Talents and Gifts of God ſhould bee hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in ſuch earth. One point of wiſedome you have learned from the men of this generation, that when your cauſe is too weake to indure any ſtrong aſſault, you would helpe it by chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7551:77"/> you an Adverſary, whom you could contemne as many wayes none of the ableſt, that ſo you might enter into almoſt all the degrees of triumph before any field was pitched. But let not the Champion pride himſelfe, the ſtones of the Brooke that refreſheth the Sanctuary of God may ſmite the forehead of his preſumption.</p>
                        <p>In your writings I conſider matter and manner. In the manner I find ſtrange ſcoffes, unchriſtian cenſures, confident, bold and ſwelling brags of the cleareneſſe of your Conceits, with an unſeemely deale of ſuch unſavory ſtuffe: all this I wholly paſſe over as unworthy to be conceived in the brest, or vented in the writings of any Scholer. The matter is both propounded, and of purpoſe repeated many times over in ſeverall trickes of elocution, the better to give a luſtre to opinion it ſelfe. The repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition I omit likewiſe. In the propounding of the matter two things are principall, fact and opinion. In matter of fact you are troubled, that your Kinſman ſhould be ſeduced, and ruined by the poiſon of ill advice ſucked from my mouth. This you would be anſwered in. And to this you have been anſwered, that it is a falſhood raiſed by your Kinſman (if hee affirme it) and magnified and blowne to the highest by your ſelfe. And you doe well to hold faſt the pretence of your opinion, that ſuch counſell was given, or elſe I cannot ſee ſo much as a glimpſe of any colour, why you ſhuld in this ſpitefull manner uſe me, or any Miniſter of the Goſpell, when you have no occaſion given you. And ſo you may be anſwered as touching matter of fact.</p>

But to cloſe with you, the word ſignifieth to prepare, apply it now to the ſeventh day, and it noteth that <hi>God bleſſed and prepared the ſeventh day</hi> above other daies of the weeke to bee ſet apart to <hi>reſt,</hi> and the memory of the great worke of the Creation, that ſo piety and religion for ever among poſterity, Gentiles aſwell as Iewes might be nouriſhed.

Now ſuch a preparation which is the actuall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a thing to uſe, is not of deſtination but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent readineſſe, and ſuch is the preparation this word ſignifieth, as may bee ſeene in <hi>Rabbi Mardochai Nathans concordance.</hi> When this word concernes <hi>holineſſe</hi> (for ſometimes it ſignifieth preparation in generall, as in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> 3. 5. to prepare warre) it ſignifieth to make holy, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 23. to declare holineſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 27. to ſet a part to an holy uſe, <hi>Ioel</hi> 1. 14. to command that it bee ſanctified, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. But to deſtinate aforehand without preſent and actuall ſeparation of the thing ſo ſoone as it doth exiſt and is capable of that to which it is ſeparated (which muſt needs be your meaning) hath no warrant of Scripture or Author that I know of.

Sanctifie them <hi>againſt the third day,</hi> but, <hi>ſanctifie them to day and to morrow, and be ready againſt the third day.</hi> So true is it alſo of the Sabbath, ſanctifie this Sabbath, and the next Sabbath and every Sabbath. It is ſenſeleſſe to talke of a preparatory ſanctification without application, that were to ſeparate to holines, and yet to let it lye common. <hi>Kades in Galilee Ioh.</hi> 20. was ſanctified, that is, ſeparated for a City of refuge; was it only deſtinated, and not actually ſet apart to that uſe?</p>
                     <p>Beſides, all thoſe <hi>ſanctifications</hi> are of <hi>perſons, not of times:</hi> was there ever a ſet time ſanctified, and the time not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſanctity actually?</p>

To be ſhort, I doubtnot but that in that ſeventh day he taught them all Divinitie, and did hold them buſied in hearing of him, and in prayſing God their Creator for ſo many and ſo great benefits. To this interpretation I am led by theſe two reaſons: The firſt, taken from the Sanctification of the Sabbath which God hath preſcribed in the Law: the ſecond, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ought to underſtand this ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a day: therefore it is probable that the Sonne of God did open this unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> both in plaine words, and by his owne example. For even God alſo is ſaid to reſt upon that day, and in <hi>Exodus,</hi> hee doth exhort to the ſanctification of the Sabbath by his owne example: therefore he did ſanctifie it with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Of this the Son of God gave us a ſhew: for having finiſhed the workes of our re-creating or Redemption, being raiſed from the dead, he converſed with his Diſciples, appearing to them through forty dayes ſpace; and ſpeaking the things that concerned the Kingdome of God, and fully inſtructing them, and teaching profound Theologie; not ſo much with words, as with the efficacie of the Spirit: He ſo reſted from both workes, that hee ceaſed not yet to teach men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the true worſhip.</p>
                     <p>The time would faile me to tell of our Engliſh worthies, famous Weſterne Lights, that teach all this Truth, as <hi>Willet, Perkins, Greenham, Babington, Bownd, Gibbens, Dod, Scharpy, Eſty, Williams,</hi> with many more: Behold what

                     <p>For further confirmation, conſider that place in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, before all mention of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law concerning the Sabbath, it is ſtoried that the <hi>People gathered on the ſixt day twice as much bread, two Omers for one man;</hi> which<note place="margin">Verſ. 22. 23.</note> thing was obſerved by the Rulers of the Congregation, who came and told <hi>Moſes</hi> of it. To what end was this, but that they might apply themſelves wholy to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath the day following?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the very phraſe and words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admonition about the Sabbath in verſ. 23, is ſuch as clearly ſheweth that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake not of the Sabbath, as ſome new thing unheard of; but cals to minde the ancient ſanctimonie of that day, which they had beene compelled to neglect of late in Egypt, through <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the very command of <hi>Moſes</hi> appointing them for after times to gather twice as much every ſixth day as they did other dayes; and giving this reaſon, on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day which is the Sabbath, <hi>in it there ſhall bee none:</hi>

It became ſay you, one of the Tenne perpetuall words then, when it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on Mount Sinai; for the morall part perpetuall, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſanctifie the Sabbath;</hi> for the ceremoniall part not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſanctifie the ſeventh day for the Sabbath.</hi> If it became ſo, becauſe ingraven by the finger of God in Tables of ſtone, then that part, thou ſhalt ſanctifie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day for Sabbath, is ſo, becauſe ſo ingraven. If it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo but then, that ſufficeth us that have lived ever ſince, and thoſe that ſhall ariſe after us to the end of the world. But this that you affirme, that then, when it was delivered on Sinai, it became one of the perpetuall words, hath no warrant in Scripture, alledge the place: nor in reaſon; for as the other nine Commandements became not then <hi>firſt perpetuall,</hi> though then <hi>firſt delivered in forme of lawes,</hi> no more did this. Were they perpetuall, becauſe <hi>written in Tables of ſtone,</hi> and not rather, <hi>becauſe perpetuall, ſo written?</hi> This alſo is ſtrange, that you ſay, that the morall part of the commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabbath,</hi> (as you will have it) became but then <hi>on Sinaia perpetuall word.</hi> Was not obliging from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and written in the heart, that there ſhould bee a vacant time for the worſhip of God?

                     <p>Firſt, concerning that place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 20. firſt, you affirme that it is underſtood by all Divines of the old Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; by all the ancient without exception; by all the latter for ought you know.] Could you know the judgement of the Ancients to be ſuch, becauſe they held that there was a tranſgreſſion of a law, in haſting their flight on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?

                     <p>Many later Divines by Sabbath underſtand all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of flight cauſed by the neceſſary and enjoyned attendance on Gods worſhip. This little favoureth your opinion, and moſt underſtand the place of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that this is the proper ſenſe of the place, will bee manifeſt to him that obſerveth three things: Firſt, the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to whom theſe words were ſpoken, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> privately, and apart on the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> verſ. 3. Secondly, the <hi>time, immediately before his death,</hi> hee ſpake of that which ſhould fall out fortie yeeres after. Thirdly, the <hi>intent of our Saviour,</hi> which was to ſhew the great evils ſhould then come to paſſe, and the miſerable exigents the enemies ſhould put them to. Now, if it be not ſpoken of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> what force could there bee in our <hi>Saviours ſpeech</hi> ſaying, pray that your flight bee not on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> who hereby intended to ſignifie that it ſhould bee a ſingular griefe to them to <hi>flie on that day.</hi> If the Sabbath had not beene in force, what vexation had it beene to the Diſciples to flie on that day more than any other: nay, it had beene an argument of comfort, <hi>and our Saviour</hi> might have ſhewed them then, that it was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mercie of God to them in ſuch ſtraites, that now they were ridde of the obligation to the Sabbath, and ſo might flie on that day, as well as any of the reſt; otherwiſe they had more neede to have prayed for knowledge to ſee their libertie in Chriſt, than to pray that they might not flie on ſuch a Sabbath, as ſhould binde them but onely in their owne conceit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this place acknowledgeth this day as <hi>His:</hi> for it is manifeſt that this flight happened about forty yeares after, when the Iewiſh Sabbath was gone: As therefore when God gave to the people the Law of the Sabbath on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it Holy;</hi> ſo the <hi>Lord Ieſus in the Mount of Olives,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that they ſhould ſtudiouſly remember even in their <hi>Prayers,</hi> the Chriſtian Sabbath many yeeres before, leſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7551:87"/> when the calamity came, <hi>its holy reſt ſhould</hi> bee intercepted with the noyſe of warlike tumults, and with a tumultuary ſlight.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you ſay, that to flie farre off on the <hi>Lords day</hi> in caſe of neceſſitie was never held unlawfull, but on that Sabbath it was.] If it were not unlawfull to flie on the <hi>Lords day</hi> in ſuch caſes, doth that make that it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and a griefe to a Chriſtian heart, to bee forced that day to forgoe the worſhip of God, and miſſe the Lord in his ordinances, and to taſte that day of his heavie wrath, in which he expects and uſes to taſte of his comforting and ſatiating bleſſings? It was not unlawfull to flie in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet it was needfull to pray, that this flight might not then be; and was it ever unlawfull in caſe of danger to flie on the Sabbath? Have you forgot all while you eagerly purſue your owne phantaſie? The <hi>Iewes</hi> hold that being ſet upon by <hi>Theeves or enemies, it was lawfull to flie that day,</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Thanchuma</hi> teacheth in <hi>Ilmedenu.</hi> 83. 4. the old rule amongſt them is knowne to all, <hi>Perill of life dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth away the Sabbath;</hi> and as well knowne is their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sabbath-dayes journey, was not an allowance in caſe of danger, and a ſtinte ſet, beyond which if they went, their <hi>judiciall lawes</hi> condemned them to death; as you ignorantly avouch.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, you ſay that the name of <hi>Sabbath</hi> was never applyed to <hi>the Lords day,</hi> by any <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> for many hundred yeeres after Chriſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet admit your ſtrong conceit had bin as ſtrong a Truth, what would follow thence? That our <hi>Saviour</hi> intended our Sabbath in that place of <hi>Matthew,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> call it the <hi>Lords day?</hi> In no caſe.

                           <p>GOod Coſin, I heartily ſalute you, and your Wife, and little Ones, and beſeech Almighty God to bleſſe both you and them. I have received the money by <hi>Graunge</hi> with your Letter. For the twenty pound I have ſent my Mother an acquittance here incloſed, which I pray you to deliver her. There was thirteene pound over, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to my Nephew <hi>Robert,</hi> and willed him to have the like care of your diſcharge. I heartily thanke you for your care and paines in my behalfe, about the ſending of that money. Touching my Nephew <hi>Iohn,</hi> whether he juſtly charged Maſter <hi>Byfield</hi> or no, (the one affirming, and the other denying it) let the juſt Iudge of all men, and of all cauſes determine, to whoſe ſentence, and the teſtimonies of their owne conſciences I leave it. Notwithſtanding, I thinke I had good reaſon to perſwade me, it was as my Nephew <note n="a" place="margin">I thinke he ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved Maſter <hi>Byfield,</hi> before his Nephew.</note> ſaid; For, firſt, I ſaw he loved and reſpected Maſter <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> very much. Secondly, as it ſeemed, it came from him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7551:92"/> ſomewhat unwillingly, as if hee was a fraid to procure Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Byfield</hi> any diſpleaſure. Thirdly, other <hi>Cheſter</hi> men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the like opinions to have growne in their ſervants, and they laid the blame on him <note n="b" place="margin">That vile aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions were caſt on Maſter <hi>Byfield</hi> at Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by many looſe perſons there, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and cauſeleſly, is a thing well knowne.</note>. Fourthly, I perceived by Maſter <hi>Byfields</hi> late letter, his judgement was, that works on the Sabbath (thoſe at leaſt that might imply breach of Sabbath, whatſoever workes thoſe were) ought not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſervants, albeit their Maſters commanded them: Confounding, as I thought, many things unskillfully, which ſhould more carefully bee diſtinguiſhed.

Secondly, the workes which ſervants do of their owne free motion, and thoſe which they doe by their maſters impoſition. Thirdly, the Lords day (in relation to Gods commandement) with the old Sabbath, as alſo the breach of Sabbath, with breach of the commandement of the Sabbath, and the like. And although you remember not, for your part, nor my Coſen your wife, the propoſing of any ſuch caſe at your table, where hee ſaith it was done <note n="c" place="margin">Thoſe at the Table teſtified, there was no ſuch Caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Breerwood</hi> will by reaſons perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there was.</note>: yet it is like he ſhould beſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it, whom it neareſt touched: that it ſhould, I ſay, have deepeſt impreſſion in his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as it found deepeſt impreſſion (as it ſeemed) in his Conſcience.

Yet thus farre withall let me, if not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, yet excuſe my paſſion to you Coſen, who have ſome Nephewes of your owne, and know the condition of my Nephew, how hard it was to bring him into a good courſe, and how apt he was to runne into an ill, being withall a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe and motherleſſe Orphane. Imagine, I ſay, how the ruine, or great likelihood of ruine <note n="g" place="margin">Suppoſe it had beene ſo indeede as you conjectured, how could his ruine have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any way ſerving ſuch a Maſter as you have heard in the anſwer to the occaſion. Chap. 36. and making conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</note> of ſuch a One, having the like relation to your ſelfe, that that Youth to mee, and being left by his dead Friends to your care, would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected you: or how this caſe of this very Youth, would have affected his Father, or Grandfather, if they had been alive. But howſoever, I remit all with all my heart. Maſter <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>

As for mee, hee may without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding this, or any other diſlike of mine. Concerning the ſending of his letter back, out of which I charged him with ſome points; I muſt intreat you to give me ſome reſpite to adviſe: for in my laſt letter to him, I have charged him with theſe points, wherein, while I have the letter, I am able to juſtifie I have not wronged him: but if the letter were out of my hands. I ſtand at his curteſie for the imputation of a ſlander, in charging him with that, which I cannot (the letter gone) bee able to proove. But this I will promiſe &amp; aſſure you Coſen, on my honeſt word, which I never have, for ought I know, and never will by the grace of God break with you, that his letter ſhal never turne him to any prejudice at all, and therwith I pray you reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted til I can otherwiſe determine. The other letter of my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes to your wife, I am forced alſo a little to deferre. Maſter <hi>Shipton</hi> cannot yet finde it, yet hee is aſſured it is in his Counting-houſe, and promiſeth ſhe ſhall aſſuredly have it, on his next leaſure to ſearch it out. I am glad with all my heart of the ſonne God hath given you: Whom I beſeech to ſend you more, to increaſe your comfort more, and to bleſſe this he hath now given you, with long life, and with the grace of his holy ſpirit, which may ever grow up with him. To Gods goodneſſe I commend you all, in much haſte, <hi>Iuly</hi> 27.</p>

                     <p>M. <hi>Breerwood</hi> kept his word: but the more hath this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher wronged him. He ſhewed in truth neither charity nor zeale in venting this booke ſo long after the deceaſe of theſe two learned men, &amp; in this ſtriking at the repute of a grave Divine, that through indignity caſt on his perſon, vility
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7551:93"/> might ſteale one his writings, which will prove more laſting then pillars of Marble, and in eſſaying to overthrow the Authority, and ſo the duties of the Lords day. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be given to him, that durſt preſume to remove the Churches old land-markes? Shall not theſe learned men deceaſed, riſe up in judgment againſt him, as againſt one that raked in their aſhes, who in their life bare, the one of them, ſtrange provoking, with ſuch modeſty and wiſdome; and concealed, the other of them, wrath and contention, and quench't it when it began to fire in his face.</p>
